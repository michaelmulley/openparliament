I will take this responsibility very seriously. There isn't a day that goes by when I don't think that even the reason for our sitting here in this House comes more from the merits of the veterans who fought for our democracy, human rights and rule of law than we did.... The democracy that we defend was earned before it was earned by us—it was earned by veterans—and I think of it every day. It's not because I'm sitting here now that I'll stop thinking about it.</ParaText>

I think the committee may agree that we send a letter to Mr. Blaney, to Ms. Adams, and Mr. Casey thanking them for their service to the veteran community while they were on the committee.
