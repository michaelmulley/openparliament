	<p data-HoCid="3372336" data-originallang="en">In view of the numerous arguments that have been raised on these questions over the past few days, the Chair believes that a comprehensive ruling on this matter is required. I will return with a detailed ruling on the matter, to be delivered at a later date.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372337" data-originallang="en">Meanwhile, however, let me simply state that I cannot conclude that the committee has exceeded the limits of its mandate in adopting the process that it has followed and that accordingly, consideration of the bill may proceed. Therefore, my ruling this morning will be limited to the selection, grouping and voting pattern with regard to the motion that appears on today's notice paper.</p>

Furthermore, Motions Nos. 4, 45 and 75 will not be selected by the Chair, since they could have been submitted to the committee for its consideration.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372340" data-originallang="en">I would like to reassure hon. members that as stated in my opening remarks, I will address the rationale for the selection of these motions and the other arguments raised in the points of order when I return to the House with a comprehensive ruling.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372341" data-originallang="fr">All remaining motions have been examined and the Chair is satisfied that they meet the guidelines expressed in the note to Standing Order 76.1(5) regarding the selection of motions in amendment at report stage.</p>

This omnibus budget bill makes changes to the temporary foreign worker program, to the Investment Canada Act, and it merges the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade with CIDA, the Canadian International Development Agency.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372483" data-originallang="en">This bill also raises taxes on Canadians by introducing tax hikes on credit unions, increasing the taxes on small businesses, and increasing the taxes on thousands of products that Canadians use every day.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372484" data-originallang="en">It took generations to establish institutions like the CBC and the central bank, and some of these institutions are the envy of the world. However, this bill would undermine the collective bargaining process at many of our crown corporations, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Via Rail, Canada Post, the CBC and the Bank of Canada.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372485" data-originallang="en"> These institutions have always been ambitious, but theirs was a vision grounded in hope and optimism. Canadians have always known that as a country we are stronger together.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372486" data-originallang="en">Our leaders once had the wisdom to accept the independence of the Bank of Canada and the integrity of the CBC. They saw this independence as an asset to our country, not a threat to the power of government.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372487" data-originallang="en">However, the Conservatives do not trust Canadians. Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="6108103" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=6108103&amp;Language=E">C-60</a>, like omnibus bills before it, are evidence of this contempt. Many of the changes in Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="6108103" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=6108103&amp;Language=E">C-60</a> are cynical measures that will give more power to the Conservative government's inner circle while taking away the voice of Parliament from independent bodies, and ultimately from Canadians.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372488" data-originallang="en">The Conservatives are making rash and ideological choices to push omnibus 3.0 through Parliament without talking to Canadians. If they had, they would have heard the kinds of things that I have been hearing from my constituents.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372489" data-originallang="en"> Parkdale—High Park, the electoral district I represent, is home to many Ukrainian credit unions. I recently met with representatives from the Council Of Ukrainian Credit Unions Of Canada, which has a combined membership of over 60,000 people across the country. The representatives I met with were shocked that they were not consulted in advance about these changes. These tax code changes were absolutely unexpected, and there was no comprehensive review of the sector before these changes were introduced in the budget.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372490" data-originallang="en">The changes have surprised people and created worry and uncertainty for credit unions and the many Canadians who rely on their services. In my riding, the Ukrainian credit unions invest nearly $1 million annually in community programming, projects and educational initiatives, which will simply disappear as a result of these changes.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372491" data-originallang="en">There is also a great deal of concern from credit unions from coast to coast about the long-term impact of these changes. We appreciate diversity in the financial sector and the banking sectors of Canada. They are part of modern economy, but I share the concerns of my constituents, and many Canadians, that these changes put that diversity at risk. However, the Conservatives would have had to talk to Canadians to know this. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372492" data-originallang="en">My office has also been flooded with letters and emails and phone calls from constituents concerned about how Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="6108103" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=6108103&amp;Language=E">C-60</a> will impact the CBC, our national broadcaster. Thousands of Canadians are writing to tell Parliament that sections relating to the CBC alone are reason to stop this omnibus bill, to make changes to it. Last week I received a letter saying:</p>
	<blockquote><p data-HoCid="3372493" data-originallang="en"> I do not want any politician exercising this kind of control over our national public broadcaster. </p>
	</blockquote><p data-HoCid="3372494" data-originallang="en"> It is not a state broadcaster.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372495" data-originallang="en">Another letter put it succinctly, saying, “What can I do; Where do I protest..”.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372496" data-originallang="en">Canadians have made it crystal clear. They do not support these measures, so why are the Conservatives not listening?</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372497" data-originallang="fr">Respected members of the Canadian media are telling Parliament that this omnibus bill needs to be intercepted. Canadian Journalists for Free Expression, the Fédération professionnelle des journalistes du Québec, the Canadian Media Guild, the Syndicat des communications de Radio-Canada and ACTRA are urging all of the Conservatives to use common sense.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372498" data-originallang="en">On issue after issue it is clear that Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="6108103" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=6108103&amp;Language=E">C-60</a> is not what Canadians want, and if the Conservatives were listening they would know that. If they had talked to Canadians, they would be hearing the advice of experts like George Smith, who has decades of experience in Canadian business. Smith was once the chief management negotiator for Air Canada, Canadian Pacific Railway and the CBC. At the finance committee Smith stated:</p>
	<blockquote><p data-HoCid="3372499" data-originallang="en"> These proposed amendments to the Financial Administration Act, buried in Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="6108103" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=6108103&amp;Language=E">C-60</a>, contradict both the spirit and intent of the Canada Labour Code...and create a role for government in crown corporation collective bargaining which is not contemplated in the Canada Labour Code. </p>
	</blockquote><p data-HoCid="3372500" data-originallang="en">Another issue of serious concern is the impact that this omnibus bill would have on the independence of the Bank of Canada. Last week, I tabled a motion at the finance committee to study the impact of this bill on the Bank of Canada, but the Conservatives voted against it, as they vote against every proposed amendment. However, in a recent article in the <em>The Globe and Mail</em>, Kevin Carmichael, one of Canada's most respected financial reporters, discussed my motion and affirmed that measures in this bill could gravely impact the independence of the bank. Again, the Conservatives are willing to sacrifice the independence of our central bank and the national interest, if it means giving more power to the Prime Minister's Office. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372501" data-originallang="en">Another measure in omnibus bill 3.0 makes changes to the temporary foreign worker program. These measures are a Band-Aid solution that does not get to the heart of the government's mismanagement of the temporary foreign worker program. Experts and community groups across the country are speaking out against this Band-Aid solution.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372502" data-originallang="en">When is it enough? Canadians are saying, once again, that they do not support this omnibus budget bill. Canadians have serious concerns with the measures in Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="6108103" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=6108103&amp;Language=E">C-60</a>, and until those concerns are addressed, we cannot support this bill and we will not support this bill.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372503" data-originallang="en">There are serious issues facing our country, but budget 2013 does not rise to meet these challenges. It does nothing to address unemployment, record levels of household debt or rising inequality. Instead, the Conservative government is more concerned with rearranging power to give more power to its inner circle and less voice to Canadians.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372504" data-originallang="en">Let us not forget what this budget is not doing. It is not getting Canadians back to work. It will not stimulate growth. Instead, this budget is squarely focused on a job-killing austerity agenda that has made major cuts to the services that Canadians rely on. Putting people to work is clearly the best way to reduce our deficit.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372505" data-originallang="en">There is no need to play big brother with the Bank of Canada. There is no need to trample on credit unions that so many communities rely on. There is no need to spend millions on an advertising budget that Canadians do not agree with.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372506" data-originallang="en"> Instead, New Democrats know that investing in education and infrastructure, making life more affordable for Canadians, supporting small and medium-sized businesses and creating high-quality, high-paying jobs is the best way to get our economy back on track.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372507" data-originallang="en">Canadians are counting on us. They are counting on New Democrats, and I dare say all of this Parliament, to show leadership and bring forward the ideas and proposals that will work in the public interest, not the private interest of a few insiders. We need to put Canadians first. This budget does not do that. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372508" data-originallang="en">I see that my time is up. I look forward to the questions and comments from my colleagues.</p>

<div class="statement" data-bill-stage="C-60,report" data-h1="Government Orders" data-h2="Economic Action Plan 2013 Act, No. 1" data-h3="Speaker's Ruling" data-intervention-type="Debate" data-person-speaking-HoCid="170182" data-person-speaking-attribution="Mr. André Bellavance (Richmond—Arthabaska, BQ)" data-timestamp="2013-05-31 10:25:00" id="8049934"><p data-HoCid="3372509" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak to our amendments to Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="6108103" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=6108103&amp;Language=E">C-60</a>.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372510" data-originallang="fr">I figured the members would be interested in talking more about this during questions and comments, so I had to hurry. Still, I will use my time to talk about why the Bloc Québécois's amendments to Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="6108103" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=6108103&amp;Language=E">C-60</a> are so important.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372511" data-originallang="fr">Once again, the government has tabled a budget implementation bill that makes many changes that are not strictly financial. Unfortunately, under the Conservative government, we have gotten used to seeing measures like these in mammoth bills. Several different committees have had to look at measures that originated with the Standing Committee on Finance and end up going back there.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372512" data-originallang="fr">It is very difficult for both MPs and Canadians to follow exactly what is going on. I think that was the government's plan when it decided to bury so many other measures in the budget implementation bill.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372513" data-originallang="fr">Today, I would like to focus on how some of our amendments relate to the Canada health transfer for Quebec. Other provinces have also expressed disapproval regarding the federal government's cuts to health transfers. The Conservatives say that they have not cut anything. They say that the budget remains the same, that it is stable. However, we are not seeing the 6% increase that was supposed to happen.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372514" data-originallang="fr">Instead of growing by 6% per year, the Canada health transfer will increase in step with economic growth, though it will never rise by less than 3%. Over time, the federal government will reduce funding for health care to a fraction of the 50% it was originally. By 2024, it will probably shrink to 18.6%.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372515" data-originallang="fr">Why do we want to get rid of that clause? We want the health transfer to continue increasing by 6%. We all know that health costs are skyrocketing in Quebec and the other provinces. The Government of Quebec reacted strongly to this decision.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372516" data-originallang="fr">When the federal government announced its plan, Quebec's finance minister reacted. A message on the Government of Quebec's website reads as follows:</p>
	<blockquote><p data-HoCid="3372517" data-originallang="fr"> While the federal budget confirms technical changes to the equalization program, Mr. Marceau pointed out that Quebec had asked that the caps that were imposed on the program in 2009 be removed. “Because of these caps, Quebec has suffered significant financial losses totalling $7.6 billion since 2009-10. Combined with budget shortfalls resulting from the federal government's unilateral decisions in 2011 regarding health care, Quebec will lose out on $8.6 billion between 2014-15 and 2024-25. Together, these unilateral changes are having a very serious negative impact on Quebec's public finances. The Government of Quebec is calling on the federal government to reverse these unfair decisions,” Minister Marceau stated. </p>
	</blockquote><p data-HoCid="3372518" data-originallang="fr">This shows what a serious impact these decisions are having. That is why I am confident that at least the members in the House from Quebec will support our call to delete this amendment on health transfers.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372519" data-originallang="fr">Of course there are other issues related to crown corporations, credit unions and securities, and I would be remiss if I did not address them. Once again, we proposed amendments to make this budget implementation bill more equitable.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372520" data-originallang="fr">In the case of credit unions, this measure was introduced in 1972 in order to allow Canadian credit unions to build capital faster. From our perspective, of course, we are particularly concerned about the Caisses Desjardins.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372521" data-originallang="fr">Most credit unions are subject to a federal corporate tax rate of about 11%, and the additional deduction for credit unions means they can enjoy a lower tax rate, since they are not otherwise eligible for the small business deduction, up to a maximum cumulative amount, which is directly related to the total amounts the credit unions owe their members. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372522" data-originallang="fr">This budget announces plans to phase out this additional deduction for credit unions over a five-year period. It will be completely eliminated by 2017.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372523" data-originallang="fr">On top of the impact on the caisses populaires members, some fear that certain branches will close if this deduction is cancelled.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372524" data-originallang="fr">The Bloc Québécois is proposing to maintain the current deduction formula. I would remind hon. members that budget 2013 is a frontal attack on several aspects of Quebec society. Eliminating the tax credit for labour-sponsored funds that help vulnerable Quebec businesses, such as Fonds de solidarité FTQ and Fondaction CSN, is just another one of the obstacles the Conservative government is putting in the way of small businesses and investors in Quebec.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372525" data-originallang="fr">Clause 15, which deals with this measure affecting credit unions and caisses populaires, should also be eliminated.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372526" data-originallang="fr">As hon. members know, the Bloc Québécois has made securities their issue for a very long time, for ages, or certainly since the current <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="78777" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=78777&amp;Language=E">Minister of Finance</a> got it in his head—in a pigheaded way, in fact—to create a Canada-wide securities commission. He wants to impose it on Quebec and the provinces.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372527" data-originallang="fr">Quebec is not the only province that is against this decision. However, this issue got a lot of ink, in Quebec in particular, and it will get even more. The Supreme Court recently made a ruling whereby the provinces, Quebec, have all the latitude they want to take care of their securities commissions themselves. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372528" data-originallang="fr">I have in hand a press release from the Government of Quebec, which slammed this decision when the Conservative <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="78777" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=78777&amp;Language=E">Minister of Finance</a> brought down his budget. Mr. Marceau says he does not understand why the federal government is insisting on setting up a Canada-wide securities commission when the rulings handed down by the Quebec Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court are clear. Minister Marceau also said he is surprised that the federal government extended the mandate of the Canadian securities transition office. This is what Minister Marceau said: </p>
	<blockquote><p data-HoCid="3372529" data-originallang="fr"> Allowing the federal government to insinuate itself in securities regulation, which is within Québec’s exclusive jurisdiction, is out of the question. </p>
	</blockquote><p data-HoCid="3372530" data-originallang="fr">It is rather surprising. Well, it is and it is not, since the government's stubbornness is not surprising. However, when the Supreme Court has given a ruling, it is time to give up. The Supreme Court made that decision for a reason, and that reason is just as clear as what is set out in the Constitution: that the jurisdictions of Quebec and the provinces must be respected.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372531" data-originallang="fr">Yet the <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="78777" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=78777&amp;Language=E">Minister of Finance</a> and his friends on Bay Street probably are telling themselves that they are in control, that they have the power and that they are going to shove this much-touted Canada-wide securities commission down the throats of Quebec and the other provinces no matter what the cost.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372532" data-originallang="fr">Take, for example, what is happening around the world. The government often brags that it prevented an economic disaster, but not all countries were so lucky. One of the reasons we were is because of our securities system, which ensures that Quebec and the provinces can have their own control system if they want. The system is working well.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372533" data-originallang="fr">The OECD has said as much about Canada's securities system. Other countries also work this way, so I do not understand why the minister would continue down the path he is taking when everyone, except perhaps his friends on Bay Street and a few provincial governments, are saying that he can have a Canadian commission if he wants but that each province, and Quebec in particular, should continue to have their own control over the securities system. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372534" data-originallang="fr">I have to wrap up, but I would be remiss if I did not mention the federal government's decision to interfere in crown corporations' collective bargaining negotiations. This is a great cause for concern. We have already seen what happened with Canada Post and what is now happening with CBC/Radio-Canada. The government wants to interfere in negotiations. Obviously, CBC/Radio-Canada's concern is maintaining control over its newsroom. This is all also related to Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="5295287" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=5295287&amp;Language=E">C-377</a>, which started making the headlines again yesterday.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372535" data-originallang="fr">In this context, the House must adopt the Bloc Québécois’s amendments to delete those provisions and ensure that the implementing legislation deals with tax measures and leaves out all the other measures that should be introduced in separate bills.</p>

	<p data-HoCid="3372537" data-originallang="fr">Regarding the securities system in Canada, the Supreme Court clearly said that the federal government has certain responsibilities with respect to the financial markets.

	<p data-HoCid="3372538" data-originallang="fr">Quebec eliminated its special access for credit unions in 2003. Therefore, Quebec agrees with the federal government on that. I simply wanted to clarify the facts about these two matters for Canadians. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372539" data-originallang="fr">What is more, I have many quotes from Quebec organizations, such as the chamber of commerce, which support our 2013 budget. I invite my colleague to read them. This is a good bill and a good budget, and he should support it. </p>

	<p data-HoCid="3372551" data-originallang="fr">As all Canadians know, our government's main priority is the economy. Whether encouraging job creation, promoting economic growth or ensuring Canada's long-term prosperity, we focus first on what matters to Canadians.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372552" data-originallang="fr">However, in recent years, Canada has faced a challenging global economic landscape that has resulted in persistent threats from outside its borders, including from the United States and Europe, two of Canada's most important trade partners.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372553" data-originallang="fr">To add to this uncertainty, Canada is dealing with increasingly intense competition from emerging economies, such as China and India. In a constantly changing global market, we must continue focusing on the economy and building on Canada's strong economic plan.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372554" data-originallang="en">Since the end of the global recession in July 2009, the Canadian economy has created more than 900,000 net new jobs. This is the very best job growth record in the entire G7. Even better, over 90% of those jobs have been full time and nearly three-quarters have been in the private sector. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372555" data-originallang="en">On top of our very strong record of job growth, Canadians can also point with tremendous pride to other strong economic fundamentals, which include the soundest banking system for over five years, according to the World Economic Forum. We have the lowest net debt to GDP ratio in the G7, and we are the only G7 country to have more than fully recovered business investment lost during the recession. This is great news for Canadians.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372556" data-originallang="en">What is more, Canada is forecasted to have among the strongest economic growth in the G7 for years ahead, according to both the IMF and the OECD. It is little wonder that all the major credit rating agencies, Moody's, Fitch and Standard and Poor's, have recently reaffirmed Canada's rock-solid Triple-A credit rating. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372557" data-originallang="en">However, we all understand that Canada cannot afford to be complacent. We cannot rest on our laurels. While our position relative to other countries is strong, now we must take the bull by the horns and build on this strength to secure long-term prosperity for our children and their children and their children.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372558" data-originallang="en">As the Vancouver Board of Trade pointed out recently, and I quote:</p>
	<blockquote><p data-HoCid="3372559" data-originallang="en"> Given the state of the global economy — where we are seeing recessions, drops in national and sub-national credit ratings, and out-of-control deficits —we are truly fortunate in Canada to be contemplating balanced budgets, receiving AAA credit ratings, and growing our GDP. </p>
	</blockquote><p data-HoCid="3372560" data-originallang="en">That is why I am so proud of economic action plan 2013. It is forward looking and would build on our solid record with measured, prudent steps that would help position Canada for long-term success, both today and well into tomorrow. It is a really positive plan for Canadians.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372561" data-originallang="fr">Many elements of this plan will be implemented with this legislation. For example, in order to build a stronger Canadian economy and help promote job growth, Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="6108103" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=6108103&amp;Language=E">C-60</a> will enable the government to extend tax relief for new investments in machinery and equipment by Canadian manufacturers; index gas tax fund payments to better support job-creating infrastructure projects in municipalities across Canada; extend the mineral exploration tax credit; provide $165 million in multi-year support for genomics research; provide $18 million to the Canadian Youth Business Foundation to help young entrepreneurs grow and develop their firms and their future; provide $5 million to Indspire for post-secondary scholarships and bursaries for first nations and Inuit students; and finally, undertake many other important initiatives on the economic front.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372562" data-originallang="en">In addition, today's legislation would help families and our communities by promoting adoption through enhancing the adoption expense tax credit; by introducing a new first-time donor super credit to encourage Canadians to donate to charity; by expanding tax relief for home care services; by providing $30 million to support the construction of housing in Nunavut; by investing $20 million in the Nature Conservancy of Canada to continue to conserve ecologically sensitive land; by providing $3 million to support training in palliative care for front-line health care providers; and by committing $3 million to the Canadian National Institute for the Blind to expand library services for the blind and partially sighted. Also, so much more is in this bill.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372563" data-originallang="en">I would like to note one last time that this legislation is an important step in creating jobs and economic growth, all while keeping taxes low and balancing the budget in 2015. I urge all members to vote in favour of this bill and support jobs, growth and long-term prosperity for all Canadians. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372564" data-originallang="en">I would caution Canadians who are listening today that they will hear two sides to this very important bill, but I want them to take an opportunity to actually look at the bill. It is available online through the Department of Finance website. The facts speak for themselves. This would be another tremendous leap forward for Canadians and for this country so that we preserve all of those jobs, create more of them and create an environment where business can flourish. Our children would benefit and the grandchildren they have would benefit for years to come.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372565" data-originallang="en"> I just wish the opposition members would reconsider their position to vote against this bill and maybe have some heart today, look into their souls, do what is right for Canadians, do what is right for taxpayers, stop blocking those all-important measures that would help Canadians and vote for this bill.</p>

	<p data-HoCid="3372567" data-originallang="en">At the industry committee, we had the changes to the Investment Canada Act. We had a little over a whopping three hours of consideration of the Investment Canada Act. There are critical changes in this act with the threshold for foreign takeovers going from $330 million to $1 billion. We heard from industry officials that this will lead to a reduction of 50% of reviews of foreign takeovers. We also had representatives from the Canadian Council of Chief Executives come to committee and say that the Investment Canada Act should be changed and modified rarely and with great consideration.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372568" data-originallang="en">I wanted to ask the parliamentary secretary if she thinks a grand total of three hours constitutes careful consideration of these huge changes, and that “rarely” would mean three consecutive budgets?</p>

	<p data-HoCid="3372570" data-originallang="en">This is something that has been looked at for years, not only by the <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="170695" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=170695&amp;Language=E">Minister of Industry</a> but also by the<a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="78738" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=78738&amp;Language=E">Prime Minister</a> himself.

We will do what is right for Canadians, as we have done since we took power in 2006.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372571" data-originallang="en">While I am on my feet, I do want to take a moment to also thank the Liberal member for <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="170626" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=170626&amp;Language=E">Kings—Hants</a>, who was instrumental in helping us at finance committee.

The members of the House took great lengths to consult in their home ridings and across Canada. They got back some phenomenal support from some of the stakeholders in their own ridings.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372575" data-originallang="en">I just want to quote a couple of them if I might. The Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters said:</p>
	<blockquote><p data-HoCid="3372576" data-originallang="en"> It's 39 years since we updated [the preferential tariffs]. It was meant to help developing countries. I mean, countries like Hong Kong and Singapore, we were giving them preferential tariffs while their per capita GDP is higher than Canada’s. [...] The solution is what the government is doing: try to negotiate free trade agreements with countries around the world so that we not only drop our tariffs, but they drop their tariffs as well. </p>
	</blockquote><p data-HoCid="3372577" data-originallang="en">This is what we were hearing. We do not want to give special breaks to companies that are working in China; we want to give benefits to Canadian companies. We do not want to give benefits to companies whose booming economies outweigh our own; we are going to do what is right for Canadians.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372578" data-originallang="en">It is unfortunate that the NDP and the other parties disagree with us.</p>

	<p data-HoCid="3372580" data-originallang="en">We heard from witnesses at the industry committee, government officials, in fact. There was no consultation on the changes to the Investment Canada Act. We heard from crown corporations that there was no consultation around changes to their labour relations. We heard from credit unions that there was no consultation. They said very clearly at the committee that no one had talked to them about very significant changes that will be affecting credit unions across the country.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372581" data-originallang="en">I think what happens, sadly, is that a few members opposite get into phone booths with people who talk and think like them, but they do not get out and listen to the rest of Canadians or do proper consultation.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372582" data-originallang="en">I would like the member to correct the record.</p>

The facts speak for themselves. There has been extensive consultation, as mentioned by a number of members who stood here today to ask questions or to make statements. There are some measures in the budget bill that are closing tax loopholes. Of course, we do not consult with those who attempt to avoid paying taxes when we close those tax loopholes. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372584" data-originallang="en">I might add that I am very disappointed in the member who just spoke. She was particularly difficult to deal with throughout all of this. She continues to be particularly difficult to deal with and continues to mislead Canadians on this. This is a good budget bill. It is a bill that would help Canadians to progress. It would create jobs. It would maintain our long-term prosperity. I just wish the NDP member would have a change of heart. </p>

	<p data-HoCid="3372586" data-originallang="fr">The Liberals continue to oppose Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="6108103" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=6108103&amp;Language=E">C-60</a> for two key reasons: this legislation threatens the independence of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and it continues to raise taxes on middle-class Canadians in order to pay for the Conservatives’ wasteful spending.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372587" data-originallang="en">At committee, the Liberals put forward several constructive amendments to help address these concerns. Unfortunately, the Conservatives refused to listen and give decent consideration to these amendments. They refused to entertain any amendments whatsoever, despite the growing evidence that Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="6108103" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=6108103&amp;Language=E">C-60</a> is in fact deeply flawed. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372588" data-originallang="en">To give an example of just how flawed the legislation is, Mr. Hubert Lacroix, the president of CBC/Radio-Canada, took the almost unprecedented step of writing to the members of the finance committee and essentially threatening a court case if Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="6108103" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=6108103&amp;Language=E">C-60</a> passes without amendment. He said that the legislation threatens the independence of the CBC and Radio-Canada. This is what he told us in his letter:</p>
	<blockquote><p data-HoCid="3372589" data-originallang="fr"> We believe that the proposed amendments to the Financial Administration Act….may conflict with key parts of the Broadcasting Act, our corporation’s governing legislation, and as a result, would reduce the independence that is critical to our operation. </p>
	</blockquote><p data-HoCid="3372590" data-originallang="en">He further stated:</p>
	<blockquote><p data-HoCid="3372591" data-originallang="en"> “[The bill]…may give rise to conflicts with the Broadcasting Act and the Charter and compromise the Corporation’s independence. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372592" data-originallang="en"> This could potentially embroil the government, our corporation, and its unions in litigation, a result that could be avoided with an amendment that protects that independence. </p>
	</blockquote><p data-HoCid="3372593" data-originallang="en">We have also heard from tens of thousands of Canadians who have signed petitions and written to their MPs in order to protest the way in which Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="6108103" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=6108103&amp;Language=E">C-60</a> threatens the independence of the CBC and Radio-Canada.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372594" data-originallang="en">Unlike the government, Canadians understand that the CBC/Radio-Canada was originally set up as an independent crown corporation in order to shield it from political interference. While the government appoints the board of directors and determines the overall budget of the CBC and Radio-Canada, this cultural crown corporation has always had the independence to determine who should work there and how much they should get paid. This legislation effectively removes that independence. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372595" data-originallang="en">Canadians have been clear. They do not want politicians to punish reporters or journalists from the CBC and Radio-Canada for asking any of us uncomfortable questions. In an effort to be constructive, Liberals tried to provide the Conservatives with options in order to address these concerns. We proposed a constructive amendment that would have excluded the CBC and Radio-Canada from the measures of Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="6108103" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=6108103&amp;Language=E">C-60</a>. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372596" data-originallang="en">We also proposed an amendment that would have simply yet clearly protected the independence of CBC and Radio-Canada from the measures in this bill so that the government could avoid a potential legal showdown, but the Conservatives would not listen to reason and consider these amendments. They seem to have become completely deaf to the concerns of Canadians. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372597" data-originallang="en">George Smith, a professor at Queen's University, who has also served as a chief management negotiator for the CBC and Radio-Canada, also appeared before the finance committee and was clear that the changes in Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="6108103" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=6108103&amp;Language=E">C-60</a> are not just bad for labour, they are bad for business. This is what Professor Smith predicts will happen under this legislation:</p>
	<blockquote><p data-HoCid="3372598" data-originallang="en"> Relationships between labour and management, which are fragile at best during stressful negotiations, will be strained to the point of breaking with the negative consequence of ensuring labour disputes. There will be costs to the economy. In sum, an already complex process will be complicated to the point where in my considered professional opinion it will become totally dysfunctional. </p>
	</blockquote><p data-HoCid="3372599" data-originallang="en">In addition to threatening the stability of CBC/Radio-Canada, one of Canada's most cherished cultural institutions, as well as endangering labour relations, this legislation actually raises taxes on Canadians. In fact, in each of the last four budgets, the Conservatives have raised taxes on hard-working, middle-class Canadian families. Their latest budget raised taxes by a whopping $3.3 billion over the next four years and a number of these tax measures are included in Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="6108103" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=6108103&amp;Language=E">C-60</a>. Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="6108103" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=6108103&amp;Language=E">C-60</a> actually attacks Canada's rural and small-town economy with a tax increase on credit unions.</p>

Asthma is a chronic lung disease that causes shortness of breath, tightness in the chest, and wheezing and coughing. Asthma affects more than three million Canadians, including me.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372617" data-originallang="en">Six out of ten people are living with uncontrolled asthma, leading to a huge loss in quality of life, productivity in the workplace and attendance at schools. It is estimated that 250 Canadians die from asthma every year. Eighty per cent of those deaths are preventable with proper education.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372618" data-originallang="en">The good news is that asthma can be controlled. Those affected by asthma can live active, symptom-free lives by becoming informed, avoiding triggers and taking medication as needed.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372619" data-originallang="en">I applaud the work of groups such as the Asthma Society of Canada, whose mission is to educate the public about asthma, promote awareness and encourage those affected by asthma to live healthy, active and productive lives.</p>

Some of the highlights of this summer include the annual summer FLOP pool party at the Forest Lawn Community Pool in July, which I co-host. In the community of Inglewood during August, we host the Calgary Fringe Festival, where visitors can enjoy the work of artists from many different backgrounds and expressions. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372622" data-originallang="en">Then there is Globalfest, which lights up the August skies with an incredible pyromusical fireworks display, and has delicious food and dance performances from many cultures in our community. </p>

	<p data-HoCid="3372626" data-originallang="fr">The Relay For Life is an opportunity to raise money, celebrate life and fight cancer. It is also a chance to honour survivors and the memory of those who have passed on. It takes enormous courage to fight this terrible disease. Research is key. Researchers have made remarkable progress, but funding is still needed.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372627" data-originallang="fr">My thoughts turn to Jack Layton, who shared this message of hope with those battling cancer: “You must not lose your own hope.”</p>

	<p data-HoCid="3372630" data-originallang="en">Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men in Canada. Overall, though, males face a higher risk of death by suicide than by prostate cancer. However, we do not talk about that. If our society is uncomfortable discussing suicide, how can we effectively prevent it? We need to break this stigma. The question is, how?</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372631" data-originallang="en"> The collateral damage project captures photographs of Canadians touched by suicide and presents a story of how they recovered and turned their experience into something positive. It encourages dialogue by letting Canadians know they are not alone.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372632" data-originallang="en">I ask Canadians to visit www.leftbehindbysuicide.org to learn more about this project. Every Canadian will be touched by suicide in their lifetime. Most will feel their experience is unique and that no one shares their pain. We need to talk about suicide, because not talking about it is not working.</p>

	<p data-HoCid="3372634" data-originallang="en">It is important to raise awareness and lessen the stigma around scoliosis, which is prevalent in girls and young women between the ages of 10 and 15, and which often makes the difficult teen years even more difficult to cope with, as I know first-hand in my role as a pediatric orthopedic surgeon.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372635" data-originallang="en">Scoliosis is an abnormal curvature of the spine that affects people of all races and socio-economic classes. In the majority of cases, we do not know the cause. Early detection provides scoliosis patients with the most options for slowing down or halting the progression of the curve, thereby often avoiding surgery.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372636" data-originallang="en">In the spirit of girl power, Curvy Girls support groups were created throughout the world. These groups are peer-led and empower girls to become leaders, make healthy choices and improve their self-esteem by diminishing the emotional impact of scoliosis through shared experiences.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372637" data-originallang="en">I want to invite everyone here to join Curvy Girls of Ottawa tomorrow at their second annual scoliosis awareness walk in Stanley Park. </p>

	<p data-HoCid="3372640" data-originallang="en">The Alberta public service and scientific community have lost a friend and respected colleague. Sadly, helicopter pilot Bryce Campbell was also killed. Also on board was fellow biologist and colleague Simon Slater, currently recovering in hospital from serious injuries.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372641" data-originallang="en">This tragedy occurred when the helicopter crashed south of Wood Buffalo National Park in northern Alberta. The biologists were tracking threatened woodland caribou populations.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372642" data-originallang="en">Kristina worked as a wildlife biologist stationed out of Athabasca and was engaged in tracking caribou. I am told she was an extremely dedicated and confident professional who truly made a difference in wildlife conservation and protection. She was well respected by her colleagues and will be deeply missed.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372643" data-originallang="en">The dedicated work of our wildlife biologists, scientists and support staff all too often places them in perilous situations.

	<p data-HoCid="3372927" data-originallang="en">In 2011, the Government of Canada made a commitment in its Speech from the Throne to create significant new protected areas. The bill before us would deliver on that commitment by amending the Canada National Parks Act to protect Sable Island National Park Reserve of Canada as Canada's 43rd national park.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372928" data-originallang="en">This initiative has garnered a high level of support in Nova Scotia, including among the Mi'kmaq. In fact, we are establishing Sable Island as a national park reserve out of respect for the ongoing negotiations under the Made-in-Nova-Scotia Process. A national park reserve enjoys the same protections that a national park does while respecting assertions of first nations rights.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372929" data-originallang="en">For many Nova Scotians, Sable Island is a mystical but real far-off place. A unique sandbar island, it is 42 kilometres long and 1.3 kilometres across at its widest point. It is home to some 190 plant species, including 20 that have restricted distribution elsewhere. It is perhaps best known for its herd of over 500 wild horses, one of the few herds in the world that remains entirely unmanaged. It was the future of those very horses that sparked the first efforts to conserve Sable Island that today culminates in this legislation.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372930" data-originallang="en">In reaction to plans in 1960 to remove the wild horses from Sable Island, schoolchildren from across Canada raised petitions, and petitioned the House of Commons. Canada came to the defence of those schoolchildren and the horses on Sable Island. In 1961, the government of the day, the government of the Right Hon. John Diefenbaker, passed regulations protecting the horses and protecting the seeds for the long-term protection of this unique and fabled landscape.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372931" data-originallang="en">Now, 50 years later, this chamber can help complete the work started by hundreds of schoolchildren decades ago by passing legislation to permanently protect Sable Island as part of Canada's world-class national parks system.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372932" data-originallang="en">There have been 350 shipwrecks recorded on Sable Island and in the vicinity of Sable Island, earning it the title of the graveyard of the Atlantic. In the past, life-saving stations, lighthouses and shelters for shipwrecked sailors were established, and today the island is used for scientific research and monitoring activities such as weather forecasting and wildlife research.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372933" data-originallang="en">I stand proudly to debate Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="5979323" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=5979323&amp;Language=E">S-15</a> today because I am probably one of the few parliamentarians in this chamber who has ever had the pleasure of setting foot on Sable Island. I have been to Sable Island probably 25 or 30 times when I worked in the offshore. We used to fly to the rig in a fixed-wing airplane that took the mail to Sable Island, land on the beach, get transferred over to the helipad and then transfer to the rig from there. I can speak with some authority to the uniqueness of Sable Island, of the shipwrecks that are on it, of the horses that are there. Those horses are very much believed to be descendants of the original horses that were taken during the expulsion of the Acadians. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372934" data-originallang="en">During the expulsion of the Acadians in 1755, horses and cattle and pigs were gathered up and put on Sable Island. The pigs quickly destroyed the trees that were still on the island at that time and they were later butchered and taken off. The cattle were used to provision the fishing fleet and the British navy and the horses themselves. It is believed that it is the descendants of those horses that are the Sable Island horses of today. I often hear people talking about Sable Island ponies, but I can tell members from experience, that there are no Sable Island ponies. These are horses in their own right, probably the true and earliest Canadian horse.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372935" data-originallang="en">Sable Island has long inspired those touched by the island's history and beauty. George Patterson penned the first formal history of the island in 1894. Nova Scotia author Thomas Haliburton inspired by the loss of the brig<em>Francis </em> in 1798 wrote “The Sable Island Ghost” in 1802. His fictional account of a ghostly woman raised support for the construction of a rescue site on the island. Among the first photographic expeditions to Sable Island was Alexander Graham Bell, who was part of an 1898 <em>National Geographic</em> visit. The late, great Stompin' Tom Connors recorded his song <em>Sable Island</em> in 1970.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372936" data-originallang="en">Sable Island is located in one of the largest offshore hydrocarbon basins in North America. The governments of Canada and Nova Scotia have agreed to prohibit drilling and to limit other petroleum-related activities on the island out to one nautical mile from the island. Industry will still be able to access Sable Island to monitor several abandoned wellheads from the 1970s and to undertake non-intrusive exploration work if authorized by the Offshore Petroleum Board in consultation, of course, with Parks Canada.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372937" data-originallang="en">As a former worker in the offshore petroleum industry, I am pleased to confirm that in case of emergency, workers will be able to seek shelter and safe harbour on Sable Island should they be taken off platforms due to emergency conditions. Parts of the bill would amend the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord Implementation Act to this effect.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372938" data-originallang="en">If members will bear with me, I will speak a bit more personally on that subject. Having worked in the offshore industry for over eight years, six and a half of them as a driller, I went through many rig abandonments. A rig had to be abandoned on a day in the early 1980s. Most of the personnel were sent to Sable Island. There were 12 of us who were deemed as necessary personnel and had to stay on board. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372939" data-originallang="en">The lads who were sent to Sable Island had quite a time. They came back with stories of some of the existing houses still on the island half full of shifting sands. There were a lot of great stories and pictures. Of course, they spent about a day and a half altogether on the island. In those days, there were several people in the weather station and it was just before Christmas. Along with our personnel were the personnel from a Yugoslavian freighter that was in danger of taking the legs out from the rig. All of those sailors, thanks to the search and rescue team from Greenwood, Nova Scotia, and Charlottetown, were rescued and harboured safely on the island. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372940" data-originallang="en">Although this is a national park, it is extremely important that in cases of emergency, the facilities on Sable Island are able to harbour individuals, whether they are on an offshore platform or fishing boats that are medevaced, or whatever the reason. We can do that in the parameters of the national parks system. There is already a helipad there. It does not have to be added. There are already some personnel on Sable Island. This could be a win-win situation, where industry and Parks Canada can work together for the benefit of all.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372941" data-originallang="en">Holders of exploration licences that include parts of Sable Island have contributed to the historic consensus to protect this remarkable island by amending their licences to prevent drilling on the island and within the buffer zone of one nautical mile. I am sure that hon. members will join me in thanking ExxonMobil Canada Properties and other licence holders for their commitment to helping protect this remarkable island as a national park reserve.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372942" data-originallang="en">Among the steps to create a national park reserve on Sable Island, administration of the island will be formally transferred from the Canadian Coast Guard to Parks Canada. With the collaboration of the <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="170675" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=170675&amp;Language=E">Minister of Fisheries and Oceans</a>, this bill would also amend the Canada Shipping Act, 2001, to remove reference to Sable Island. The Sable Island regulations would be revoked, and instead the island would be subject to the regulatory regime under the Canada National Parks Act. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372943" data-originallang="en">At this time, I would like to thank and congratulate the <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="170686" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=170686&amp;Language=E">Minister of Natural Resources</a> and the <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="170675" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=170675&amp;Language=E">Minister of Fisheries and Oceans</a> for their work in helping create a national park reserve on Sable Island. The Government of Canada is proud to table this bill to give Sable Island the highest level of environmental protection in the country for the enjoyment, appreciation and benefit of current and future generations of Canadians.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372944" data-originallang="en">Turning now to other aspects of Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="5979323" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=5979323&amp;Language=E">S-15</a>, including important matters related to two of Canada's oldest national parks, Yoho National Park and Jasper National Park, I will briefly describe the other proposed amendments to the Canada National Parks Act made in the second part of the bill. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372945" data-originallang="en">The bill before us would modify the French version of subsection 4(1) of the Canada National Parks Act to align the French version with the English version. It would also add a new subclause, subclause 4(1.1), that states for greater certainty that nothing in section 4 limits the ability of the minister responsible for the Parks Canada Agency to charge fees in national parks under either sections 23 or 24 of the Parks Canada Agency Act. These changes address concerns raised by the Standing Joint Committee for the Scrutiny of Regulations. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372946" data-originallang="en">The provisions affecting Yoho National Park make minor changes to the description of the commercial zones for the community of Field, British Columbia, located within Yoho National Park of Canada. These zoning modifications are well within the legislative commercial growth limit for Field, they reflect public consultations carried out and they respond to concerns for business operations and residents of the community. They are important to the economic viability of the community of Field, British Columbia.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372947" data-originallang="en">The proposed amendments that would affect Jasper National Park relate to the ski area at Marmot Basin within the boundaries of the park. The operator wishes to improve the ski experience in order to remain competitive with other new and expanded ski operations in the region and to stay financially viable. The operator has presented Parks Canada with an opportunity to achieve a significant environmental gain in the process.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372948" data-originallang="en"> Development of ski areas within a national park is strictly controlled by legislation, by ski area guidelines, by site-specific guidelines and by leases and licences of occupation. Changes to the size and configuration of the ski area boundaries require an amendment to the Canada National Parks Act. The growth limits in the site guidelines for the Marmot Basin ski area are based on a design capacity of 6,500 skiers per day, but the existing commercial space can serve less than 3,000 skiers. There is a need for additional facilities and services, and they must be developed in a strategic manner to achieve a better ski experience and respect conservation imperatives. The ski area management guidelines would allow ski areas to add new ski terrain only through an exchange that results in substantial environmental gain to the ecological integrity of the national park.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372949" data-originallang="en"> This is what is proposed in the bill before us. Marmot Basin ski area would remove from its lease 118 hectares of ecologically sensitive land in the Whistlers Creek valley. The area is an important habitat for woodland caribou, which is listed under the Species at Risk Act, as well as habitat for sensitive species such as the grizzly bear, wolverine and lynx. In exchange, the ski area would receive 60 hectares of comparatively less environmentally sensitive habitat for the new ski trails and the beginner runs. This is a win-win situation for the ski hill and for Jasper National Park, resulting in a net increase of 56 hectares of wilderness area to the park and the protection of future development of 118 hectares of prime woodland and caribou habitat.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372950" data-originallang="en">The creation of Sable Island National Park Reserve of Canada, which is near and dear to my heart, would build on the Government of Canada's impressive achievements in protecting our natural and cultural history. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372951" data-originallang="en">In conclusion, I hope hon. members will join with me in supporting this bill. This work started more than 50 years ago. By protecting Sable Island today as a national park reserve under the Canada National Parks Act, we can expect an important addition; even though it is an island and obviously Tertiary, the water surrounding Sable Island National Park in the nautical mile buffer zone is a very important addition.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372952" data-originallang="en">For those members who have never had an opportunity to visit Sable Island, I urge them to do so. It is absolutely a unique place on the east coast of Canada, and the island continues to shift. It is continually in movement. We flew out and landed on Sable Island on one of the trips to the oil rig, and there was a vessel approximately 130 to 140 feet long, a steel ship, sitting upright on the bar of Sable Island. This was a vessel that had been wrecked on Sable Island back in the 1950s. I cannot say if there was any loss of life, but the vessel is still out there today. Over the period of the fall and before Christmas, that vessel, of which the spar probably would have been 60 feet off of the sands of Sable Island, was again totally covered in sand and one would not know if one had not seen it oneself that the vessel had been totally out of the sand and open on the island.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372953" data-originallang="en">That is the type of terrain there. It is an amazing addition to the Canada National Parks Act and I urge all hon. members to support this legislation. This is a great piece of legislation.</p>

In fact, I agree with a lot of what he said. Sable Island is a magnificent place that must be preserved and given national park designation. We agree on that.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372955" data-originallang="fr">The thing I am not so sure I understood from my colleague's speech is that he seems to fully support the bill. I wonder whether he thinks there is cause to propose some amendments to this bill.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372956" data-originallang="fr">I could add a second part to my question. I wonder about the expression “low-impact development”. I am not sure if my colleague knows exactly what is meant by “low-impact”, what that implies and what this protects us from.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372957" data-originallang="fr">I think that if we do not fully understand this expression, then we cannot really fully support this bill. Can the hon. member tell me what he thinks about that?</p>

The answers deserve to be given in this House. Her first question was whether or not I would support the bill without amendments. I absolutely would support the bill without amendments. That does not mean there cannot be amendments made that possibly could support the bill, but as I understand the bill right now, it is the proper bill for both Sable Island and for the other two national parks that were mentioned, Yoho National Park and Jasper National Park.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372959" data-originallang="en">The second question was on low-impact development. As I said in my remarks, low-impact development will only result when there is a land swap, so if a commercial entity that is operating, for instance, a ski hill in a national park needs to expand and it can expand in an area of that park that is not ecologically sensitive, then it has to actually swap land and property that increases the size of the park, and that land has to be ecologically sensitive.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372960" data-originallang="en">In the case of the ski hill that I mentioned, that is exactly what it has done. It will be increasing the size of the park and adding ecologically sensitive land to it in exchange for the non-ecologically sensitive land that will allow for the expansion of the ski hill.</p>

Based on the past history of the government, being a parliamentary secretary, the member knows very well that there have not been any amendments and the government has not been open to any amendments on bills. I am not saying there are going to be any amendments, but we are going to be listening to witnesses at committee because this is going to be a very delicate type of bill to pass, making sure all parties are happy with the bill we would be passing.</p>

I have seen a lot of bills by other governments and by our own government come to this place, and often there is some tweaking that is required of them. However, in this entire piece of legislation, we have a unique partnership between the Province of Nova Scotia and the Government of Canada. There is a recognition of aboriginal rights and the importance of allowing those aboriginal claims to be settled before this would actually become a national park and part of the national parks system of Canada. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372963" data-originallang="en">It recognizes the fact that there are a number of existing wellheads on Sable Island now that will require monitoring by Mobil Oil or the other companies that have drilled wells on that island. It recognizes the fact that this is an important hydrocarbon basin. When I worked in the offshore, we drilled a directional well right under Sable Island, so there is no question that there can be industry there without hurting the landscape on Sable Island. There is a great partnership between—</p>

	<p data-HoCid="3372967" data-originallang="en">I wish my colleague to comment on two things. First, he spoke very briefly about the partnership the bill includes. I believe it is already passed almost in mirror form in the Nova Scotia Legislature.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372968" data-originallang="en"> Would he talk about what the island means to the local community and the partnership to take it to this place? Would he also speak to the fact that committee study is a very proper and good tool to look at legislation, even as good as this, and that certainly he would support a rigorous study at committee, should the bill be supported by all parties to get it to committee in the near future?</p>

I absolutely agree. Rigorous committee study is important to any piece of legislation. Whether that legislation is by the previous government or our government, it is important to make sure the legislation is crafted properly. Quite frankly, often we do find some mistakes in legislation, and amendments need to be made to correct those.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372970" data-originallang="en">The partnership, which I was speaking to earlier, is extremely important. There are some changes made to the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board to recognize the difference of a national park reserve.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372971" data-originallang="en"> There will be an ongoing partnership now with the Province of Nova Scotia and with the Mi'kmaq of Nova Scotia, and this bill quite frankly recognizes the importance, not just of partnerships but of collaboration and working for the benefit of all.</p>

	<p data-HoCid="3372989" data-originallang="en">It is my pleasure to speak to this bill. The designation of Sable Island as a full national park has been long in coming and is welcomed by many quarters. Nonetheless, there have been a number of outstanding issues. It appears that all the parties have come together to a certain extent to resolve those matters. However, there have been discussions in the House about the comments made by the parliamentary secretary. There may still be a need for some discussion at committee. What our party certainly does not want to do in any way is slow down or stop the full designation of Sable Island as a national park.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372990" data-originallang="en">Sable Island is a unique area. It is a sandbar island, off the coast of Nova Scotia, over 40 kilometres long and only 1.3 kilometres wide at its widest point. It is home to 190 plant species, including 20 that have restricted distribution and are not found elsewhere, and a remarkable herd of 450 wild horses.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372991" data-originallang="en">It was that herd of horses that first brought the effort to conserve the island and protect their habitat. However, since that time, there have been many more revelations about the importance, significance and uniqueness of this island. Therefore, it is good news that all parties have come together to try to designate and set aside this area for future prosperity.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372992" data-originallang="en">To that end, this act declares Sable Island national park reserve a full national park. That means it shifts to having full protection. However, as some of the members have indicated in the House, there are some questions about the extent of that full protection.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372993" data-originallang="en">It is my understanding that conditions put on other parks, such as Gwaii Hanaas, Nahanni and so forth, are being imposed on Sable Island national park reserve, or would be imposed when it is designated. That includes allowing for first nation harvest rights and so forth.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372994" data-originallang="en">There are additional problems, which I am quite familiar with from when I was the assistant deputy of natural resources in the Yukon. That was during the time when the majority of the first nation final agreements were being negotiated and included dealing with the issue of pre-existing mineral rights and interests on claimed lands. This legislation attempts to deal with those potentially conflicting rights and interests and also the jurisdiction and power of the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord Implementation Act.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372995" data-originallang="en">I will not go into the details of those provisions. They would be discussed at committee should the bill be voted to go to committee. However, one issue that needs to be clarified and resolved is the extent to which pre-existing rights would be honoured.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372996" data-originallang="en">It is my understanding that in designating the park, the decision was made to remove any right to actually extract petroleum resources on Sable Island or within a perimeter of, I believe, one mile offshore. The problem is that there is considerable offshore oil activity in the vicinity and the potential for direct or indirect drilling.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372997" data-originallang="en">A question was raised by one of my colleagues about the term “low impact”. The law would allow for certain low-impact activities to occur. Unfortunately, the legislation does not specify what those are. I am sure that will be a matter for discussion and debate at committee. I look forward to the presentations by other members on that aspect.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372998" data-originallang="en">It also amends the Canada Shipping Act, including the transfer of jurisdiction from the Coast Guard to Parks Canada.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3372999" data-originallang="en">One of the outstanding issues, which I look forward to being fully addressed, is that the preamble of the bill designating Sable Island national park reserve refers to Mi'kmaq asserted rights and title. The problem is that a preamble is not legally binding. It may well be that they may want to pursue some kind of substantive provision within the act and associated regulations and so forth to clarify that those rights are recognized. That is important, because there have been previous determinations by the Federal Court that previously, the government erred in law by making decisions on the protection of habitat of species without giving due consideration to aboriginal rights and title.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373000" data-originallang="en">I note that the chief of the Paq'tnkek first nation, which is one of the Mi'kmaq nations, advises that they have not been consulted. Perhaps that has happened since he stated that. They are calling for more in-depth archeological studies on the island connected to their previous occupation. I am hopeful that they may be brought forward to committee. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373001" data-originallang="en">The Conservatives initially wanted to make the designation subject to all other federal laws. This was a rather reprehensible proposal, because all other national parks have said the opposite, which is that the National Parks Act would supersede all other laws, which is obviously important when designating an area for protection. My understanding is that they have withdrawn from that suggestion. I look forward to hearing clarification on that.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373002" data-originallang="en">Finally, I would like to speak to the parts of the bill that deal with changes to Jasper National Park. As the parliamentary secretary has said, the bill deals with an exchange of properties to allow for the Marmot Basin ski project to potentially develop in the future. Presumably there was some kind of evaluation and assessment in this exchange and Marmot ski development would give up areas that are more ecologically sensitive for ones that are less ecologically sensitive.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373003" data-originallang="en">I cannot speak to that in detail. I am not sure who was engaged in that review. I do not know if it was an open review. I look forward to more detail being provided on that in committee. It is absolutely critical, because under the National Parks Act, the minister is obligated to give priority to ecological integrity in making any decisions about the management of the parks.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373004" data-originallang="en">That is potentially a matter that might come forward. My understanding is that nobody has specifically objected to the switch of the lands, but there are ongoing concerns, because a number of threatened species are potentially at risk.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373005" data-originallang="en">Three or four herds of caribou in Jasper National Park are close to extirpation. Those are the last remaining herds that have any level of protection in my province. Essentially, for all the eastern slope herds, the provincial government has declared, “let them be extirpated”. All the herds in northern Alberta where the oil sands developments are occurring are also at risk.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373006" data-originallang="en">There will be a lot of attention to the commitment by the federal government to step up to the plate and ensure that these last remnants of the caribou herds get full protection.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373007" data-originallang="en">Again, as I mentioned, a previous court case was brought by a number of Alberta first nations because of the federal government's failure to actually directly consult and consider any impacts on first nation rights and title in deciding whether to protect the critical habitat of the woodland caribou. The court ruled that the minister had erred in law by determining that he did not have to consult and consider those rights. The Federal Court thoroughly chastised the minister for this erring in law, and this matter has continued to spin round and round.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373008" data-originallang="en">According to National Park policy, the ski operators must demonstrate a substantial environmental gain from their plans. What people interested in the protection of this area will be watching for under the new regime of the Canadian Environment Assessment Act is whether there will be a thorough environmental assessment of any plans to expand in this area they will be allowed to expand into. Will Canadians who are concerned and dedicated to the protection of the species in that area be allowed to fully participate?</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373009" data-originallang="en">The government has been moving to try to limit participation by Canadians. I would think this would be a good chance to show and exercise good will and be forthright and say that it intends to ensure a full environmental assessment and full participation by people, even if it does not deem them to be directly impacted.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373010" data-originallang="en">I would just like to close with some words of Alison Woodley, director of conservation for the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society. She said:</p>
	<blockquote><p data-HoCid="3373011" data-originallang="en"> Parks Canada policy requires that the operator demonstrate that there will be a substantial environmental gain from the overall plan. In our view, it is highly unlikely that there will be a substantial environmental gain achieved through a Marmot Basin ski area expansion and that the potential new development could cause harm to park wildlife, including woodland caribou, which have dropped to critically low numbers in the park and are at risk of disappearing. </p>
	</blockquote><p data-HoCid="3373012" data-originallang="en">There is good will on the part of all parties, but there are still significant questions remaining. I think the ball is in the court of the government to step forward in both of these matters and assure the public and those concerned that those matters will be addressed and that they will protect the integrity of our national parks.</p>

	<p data-HoCid="3373014" data-originallang="en">There are opportunities for us to drill into some of these issues in committee. I am very glad that we are having a productive and respectful debate on an important subject, which is this park.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373015" data-originallang="en">I wanted to address one of the areas she brought up with regard to the definition of low-impact exploration activities. I believe that one of my colleagues also brought this up in a question. Some of the examples raised in a previous study of this bill have been related to the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board issuing a call for bids that included the subsurface of Sable Island from time to time. A company that had a successful bid would need to access the island to undertake activities to further refine its understanding of the petroleum potential in the greater Sable Island area.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373016" data-originallang="en">I think the last time something like this happened was in 1999. A company undertook a 3D seismic program. It temporarily installed listening devices and vibrating devices to provide a sound source. However, this particular activity was subject to permits and so on.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373017" data-originallang="en">Is this the type of information that meets the specificity she would be expecting in a committee study, which we would look forward to engaging in?</p>

The problem is that, yes, there is a listing of activities, but then there is a wide open bucket of things that could occur, which is called “low-impact activities”.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373019" data-originallang="en">The one provision of greatest concern is “petroleum exploration activities with a low impact on the environment”. What is that? If one talked to the oil and gas industry, many of them would say that there is absolutely no impact, because they manage <em>x</em>, <em>y</em> and <em>z</em> safely. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373020" data-originallang="en">Given how small and sensitive this area is, there is a need for a very specific definition to give assurance to everyone into the future. As to what legal mechanism we can come up with, I look forward to the innovative ideas of the Government of Canada.</p>

It is clear that she is well versed in the subject through her background in environmental law.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373022" data-originallang="fr">I have a question for her about the cuts the Conservative government made last year to the national parks. A number of national parks employees were laid off and will be replaced with signs. I was sad to hear this, because future generations could benefit from this wealth.</p>

<div class="statement" data-bill-stage="S-15,2" data-h1="Government Orders" data-h2="Expansion and Conservation of Canada's National Parks Act" data-intervention-type="Interjection" data-person-speaking-HoCid="170183" data-person-speaking-attribution="Ms. Linda Duncan" data-timestamp="2013-05-31 12:50:00" id="8050616"><p data-HoCid="3373024" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague for her dedicated work on environmental measures in the federal area. She raises a big issue, not just about the interpretation of the area but about the recent very deep cuts to the number of scientists, interpreters and so forth at Environment Canada and Parks Canada. Given that both of these matters, and also, Yoho Park, which I did not speak to, will need a high level of scientific scrutiny and close monitoring, it does raise concerns. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373025" data-originallang="en">Sable Island, as the parliamentary secretary who spoke to the bill said, is a terrain that is changing all the time. There are hundreds of unique plant species and so forth there. Who is going to be monitoring this? Who is going to be monitoring and acting as watchdog over these so-called low environmental impacts? </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373026" data-originallang="en">For the ski area, we will want some assurance about who is going to be brought in to actually do this close evaluation of any future expansion into another part of the park of the commercial activities related to skiing. We are going to need assurances that if they do not have the scientists in-house anymore who can be accessed, they will draw upon independent scientists. They could include the wonderful, qualified scientists we have in Alberta.</p>

<div class="statement" data-bill-stage="S-15,2" data-h1="Government Orders" data-h2="Expansion and Conservation of Canada's National Parks Act" data-intervention-type="Debate" data-person-speaking-HoCid="170149" data-person-speaking-attribution="Ms. Laurin Liu (Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, NDP)" data-timestamp="2013-05-31 12:50:00" id="8050618"><p data-HoCid="3373027" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member who spoke before me, the member for <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="170183" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=170183&amp;Language=E">Edmonton—Strathcona</a>. She gave a wonderful overview of Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="5979323" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=5979323&amp;Language=E">S-15</a>. I am pleased to rise in the House to speak to this Senate bill.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373028" data-originallang="fr">We know that in 2011 the federal government and the provincial NDP government negotiated an agreement to make Sable Island a national park. Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="5979323" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=5979323&amp;Language=E">S-15</a> was drafted as a result of that agreement.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373029" data-originallang="fr">Basically, Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="5979323" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=5979323&amp;Language=E">S-15</a> proposes that Sable Island become a national park reserve. It should be noted that unlike a national park, which does not allow for aboriginal land claims within the park area, a national park reserve designation allows the government to continue land claim negotiations.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373030" data-originallang="fr">That detail is very important here because the Mi'kmaq people of Nova Scotia are currently asserting ancestral rights to the island.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373031" data-originallang="fr">We must acknowledge the presence of first nations on the territory now known as Canada. As my colleague for <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="170183" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=170183&amp;Language=E">Edmonton—Strathcona</a> mentioned, we need to ensure that there are proper consultations with first nations.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373032" data-originallang="fr">I hope that the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development will invite first nations to appear before the committee so they can share their views. We know that the bill's preamble is not binding. We must ensure that this bill reflects the rights of first nations when it is implemented.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373033" data-originallang="fr">All the members of the House have said that Sable Island is a place Canadians should be proud of. Canadians all across the country know of this long, narrow, crescent-shaped island in the north Atlantic, southeast of Nova Scotia, because of the wild horses that inhabit the island.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373034" data-originallang="fr">Over 190 plant species have been identified on Sable Island, and it is home to the world's largest grey seal colony in the world as well as 350 species of birds. That is why it is so important that we protect this Canadian ecological gem.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373035" data-originallang="fr">By the way, I would like to thank everyone who works at the Centre d'interprétation de la nature de Boisbriand, in my riding of Rivière-des-Mille-Îles. This interpretive nature centre is a natural, wooded conservation area that covers approximately 42,500 m<sup>2</sup> and borders the Mille-Îles river. Thanks to their efforts, our children and our children's children will be able to enjoy our flora and fauna as past generations were able to do.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373036" data-originallang="fr">I would like to commend them for their hard work in the area of conservation, since that is what we are talking about this afternoon. These people are making sure that future generations will be able to enjoy our natural resources. In my opinion, we need to consider the issue of intergenerational equality.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373037" data-originallang="fr">It is also important to mention that this Conservative government is leaving an ecological debt for future generations. We know that the federal government sabotaged parks by making cuts to national parks last year. For example, the government made $29 million in cuts to the parks' budget last year, and over 600 biologist and park interpreter jobs were lost.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373038" data-originallang="fr">These people will no longer be available in our national parks to share their ecological and scientific knowledge with Canadians across the country. We know that, in some cases, park interpreters are being replaced with interpretive signs.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373039" data-originallang="fr">We also know that the <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="78738" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=78738&amp;Language=E">Prime Minister</a>'s Conservatives committed to meeting the conservation targets set out in the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. However, they are not doing so.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373040" data-originallang="fr">Unfortunately, Canada is protecting only 10% of its land area and 1% of its waters. The Conservatives do not have a very good track record in this regard. I think that future generations will inherit this debt from this backward-thinking Conservative government.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373041" data-originallang="fr">What is more, the Conservative government has eliminated major environmental protection measures in Canada. Take for example the elimination of 98% of federal environmental assessments, the elimination of 98% of the measures to protect Canada's navigable waters and the elimination of measures to protect most fish habitats.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373042" data-originallang="fr">I was very sad to learn that the environment museum located in the Montreal Biosphere would open its doors for the last time this summer. In July 2012, the Conservative government made significant cuts to the Biosphere. Now, most of the staff is being cut.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373043" data-originallang="fr">We recently learned that Environment Canada has unilaterally decided to review the mandate of the environment museum, which will not survive if it no longer has any staff. The people who are being targeted are museum professionals, educators, guides, designers and technicians.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373044" data-originallang="fr">If the Conservative government really cared about sharing scientific and technical knowledge with the public, it would not have made these drastic cuts to our parks and museums, which are our country's true treasures.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373045" data-originallang="fr">That being said, I support the bill at second reading because it seeks to protect the history and beauty of Sept-Îles. I applaud the work done by the environmental groups who have joined forces to protect Sept-Îles.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373046" data-originallang="fr">As I said, I will be supporting this bill at second reading. However, I must say that the wording of this bill does raise some concerns. As my colleagues have already mentioned, the bill prohibits drilling within one nautical mile of the island, as well as drilling on the island's surface. However, in exceptional circumstances, exploration activities will be allowed on the island, which is a first in any national park. These exploration activities will be limited to those with a low impact on the environment. However, the bill fails to clearly define those exploration activities. I believe that the House of Commons Standing Committee on Environment needs to have a closer look at this issue in order to clearly define the term “low impact” and clearly define the exploration activities that will be allowed under this provision.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373047" data-originallang="fr">As it stands, the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board will have to consult with Parks Canada before issuing licences for petroleum-related activities. The board would have the discretionary power to include in the terms and conditions any mitigation or remedial measures that the company must take.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373048" data-originallang="fr">I hope the Standing Committee on Environment will invite many experts in order to properly examine the bill. Having been a member of the Standing Committee on Environment, I have witnessed first-hand this government's unbalanced approach to conservation. The government muzzles Canadian scientists and refuses to listen to experts or scientists who work on conservation. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373049" data-originallang="fr">Throughout this parliamentary session, Conservative members who sit on the various committees have refused to adopt the amendments proposed by opposition members, even though those amendments were based on testimony from experts and reliable information gathered in committee. The goal of such amendments is always to improve bills and make them better, including through public consultation. For once I hope the government members will accept the amendments proposed in committee by opposition members, who work very hard on the committee. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373050" data-originallang="fr">I now look forward to questions from my hon. colleagues.</p>

	<p data-HoCid="3373052" data-originallang="en">I would like to give my colleague the opportunity to speak to a specific recommendation that perhaps she would have and perhaps to take a moment to retract some of the incorrect comments that she made, including the 99% environmental screening component. The Commissioner of the Environment said in the subcommittee on Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="3961709" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=3961709&amp;Language=E">C-38</a>:</p>
	<blockquote><p data-HoCid="3373053" data-originallang="en"> The majority of screenings are very small projects for which there are no significant adverse environmental impacts. The agency has estimated that 94% of screenings would not pose significant adverse environmental impacts. </p>
	</blockquote><p data-HoCid="3373054" data-originallang="en">I would like the member to comment on that statement. Since she raised it in debate perhaps she could also talk about whether or not, since the Commissioner of the Environment says that 94% of these small screenings do not have significant environmental impacts, she believes that the money and time spent on these screenings is better spent on no environmental impact rather than the larger environmental impact assessments where the funding is now going.</p>

	<p data-HoCid="3373056" data-originallang="fr">We really did not have the time to debate these changes in the House of Commons. That is another sign that the Conservative government refuses to be accountable to the Canadian people. Canadians across the country expressed their opposition to the changes made by the Conservative government. Moreover, the government sabotaged the consultation process for these environmental assessments. That is what I am hearing from my constituents and that is disturbing. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373057" data-originallang="fr">A number of Conservative members have risen in the House of Commons to talk about conservation. However, I would really like to hear from the members who represent the following areas: Riding Mountain in Manitoba; Point Pelee in Ontario; Banff and Jasper in Alberta; and Prince Albert in Saskatchewan.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373058" data-originallang="fr">Canadians have had to volunteer to maintain national parks because of the Conservative government's cuts.</p>

	<p data-HoCid="3373060" data-originallang="fr">As she pointed out, the Conservative government committed to achieving the conservation targets in the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. It committed to protecting at least 17% of land habitat and 10% of marine areas by 2020. However, the government is seriously behind schedule, because only 10% of land areas and 1% of marine areas are protected.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373061" data-originallang="fr">I would like my colleague to explain why it is very important, even crucial, that these targets be met.</p>
	</div>
<div class="statement" data-bill-stage="S-15,2" data-h1="Government Orders" data-h2="Expansion and Conservation of Canada's National Parks Act" data-intervention-type="Interjection" data-person-speaking-HoCid="170149" data-person-speaking-attribution="Ms. Laurin Liu" data-timestamp="2013-05-31 13:05:00" id="8050638"><p data-HoCid="3373062" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his question.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373063" data-originallang="fr">These targets are essential for several reasons. Canada has become an international laughingstock because the government refuses to meet its targets under international agreements such as the Kyoto protocol. In addition, the <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="165138" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=165138&amp;Language=E">Minister of the Environment</a> withdrew Canada from the protocol in 2011, without consulting Canadians or even the other countries.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373064" data-originallang="fr">The international community was not even aware that Canada was pulling out until the very last minute. The government refuses to take positive action on the environment and is waiting for a Senate bill to do so—because we know that Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="5979323" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=5979323&amp;Language=E">S-15</a> originated in the Senate.

<div class="statement" data-bill-stage="S-15,2" data-h1="Government Orders" data-h2="Expansion and Conservation of Canada's National Parks Act" data-intervention-type="Debate" data-person-speaking-HoCid="170377" data-person-speaking-attribution="Mr. Massimo Pacetti (Saint-Léonard—Saint-Michel, Lib.)" data-timestamp="2013-05-31 13:05:00" id="8050640"><p data-HoCid="3373065" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="5979323" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=5979323&amp;Language=E">S-15</a>, which would amend the Canada National Parks Act to create the Sable Island national park reserve of Canada, the culmination of years of work by the Governments of Canada and Nova Scotia and by various stakeholders to protect Sable Island's unique nature and ecosystem. At present, Sable Island, an ecological gem, is afforded little protection and does not have protected status.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373066" data-originallang="en">Sable Island lies approximately 290 kilometres southeast of Nova Scotia. It is a long, crescent-shaped island in the North Atlantic. While its topography is characterized by sand dunes and grasses, it is home to a significant biodiversity, including 375 wild horses, 350 species of birds, 190 plant species and the largest colony of grey seals in the world. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373067" data-originallang="en">Sable Island is world-renowned not only for its biodiversity but for its shipwrecks. Since 1583, there have been more than 350 recorded shipwrecks on or near the island, earning it the title of “Graveyard of the Atlantic”.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373068" data-originallang="en">Given the unique ecosystem found on the island, in 2004 the federal and Nova Scotia governments concluded that it would be in the public interest to use a federally protected area designation to achieve conservation objectives for Sable Island. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373069" data-originallang="en">In 2010, a memorandum of understanding, or MOU, was signed to establish a federally protected area on Sable Island. Following the MOU, public consultations were held with members of the public and with the Mi'kmaq of Nova Scotia to consider whether to establish a national wildlife area under the Canada Wildlife Act or a national park under the Canada National Parks Act. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373070" data-originallang="en">In the end, the consultations recommended that Sable Island be designated a national park, and on October 17, 2011, the Governments of Canada and Nova Scotia signed an MOU to establish a national park on Sable Island. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373071" data-originallang="en">The island will be designated as a national park reserve in recognition of the fact that the island is subject to a claim of the Mi'kmaq. The Mi'kmaq and the Governments of Nova Scotia and Canada are currently negotiating this claim. The designation as a national park reserve allows the governments to continue these land claim negotiations.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373072" data-originallang="en">Conserving Sable Island poses a challenge because of the wealth of resources in and around the island. Sable Island has been at the centre of oil and gas activities for the last 50 years. Offshore hydrocarbon exploration began in the 1960s. To date, the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board has made 23 significant discovery declarations in offshore Nova Scotia, eight of which have been declared commercial discoveries. From the commercial discoveries, 53 billion cubic metres of natural gas has been produced from Sable Island offshore energy fields. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373073" data-originallang="en">Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="5979323" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=5979323&amp;Language=E">S-15</a> would put into law an existing prohibition against drilling on Sable Island. Importantly, five oil companies that have been granted exploration licences for on-island drilling have voluntarily agreed to relinquish these rights. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373074" data-originallang="en">Let me say clearly that the Liberal Party is strongly in favour of the establishment of Sable Island national park reserve. Sable Island must be protected. In fact, the bill coming out of the Senate had the support of Liberal Party senators. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373075" data-originallang="en">However, the Liberal Party has concerns with the legislation that we feel are important and should be addressed at the committee stage. The Liberal Party would like to ensure that rigorous environmental protections and safeguards are maintained for this national park reserve. As well, we must ensure that any concerns by the Mi'kmaq with regard to the legislation have the opportunity to be addressed.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373076" data-originallang="en">Liberals also have several concerns regarding the extent and oversight of natural resource development that Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="5979323" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=5979323&amp;Language=E">S-15</a> authorizes, specifically as it permits horizontal drilling underneath the island as well as low-impact exploration activities on the island. We would like to know what the government defines as “low impact” and what the effect would be on species at risk.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373077" data-originallang="en">The Liberal Party is in favour of responsible and sustainable resource development. However, we believe that development projects like these must adhere to the most stringent environmental assessments. We must ensure that Sable Island is environmentally protected and that development does not detrimentally affect the ecosystem. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373078" data-originallang="en">We understand the economic value that developing the oil and gas resources in and surrounding Sable Island would provide Nova Scotia. However, Sable Island is a particularly sensitive ecosystem and is, as I have mentioned, home to a wealth of biodiversity as well as many species at risk, and it is important to find the right balance.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373079" data-originallang="en">Other concerns include the following. The bill contains changes to the dedication clause, as well as changes to land borders in Jasper National Park, while the exchange of land between Parks Canada and the operators of Marmot Basin would have a detrimental impact on species in the area. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373080" data-originallang="en">Another concern regards clause 3, an exception to the application of the Canada National Parks Act with regard to existing leases, easements and licence of occupation and work on Sable Island. Why the allowance of renewal of licences? How many leases and licences are currently in place that affect Sable Island? We have also asked for that list from the minister's office and hope it will be provided at committee stage.

	<p data-HoCid="3373091" data-originallang="en">I believe the government does want Sable Island protected and Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="5979323" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=5979323&amp;Language=E">S-15</a> is an important first step.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373092" data-originallang="en"> In closing, I ask that the government not use the bill as a precedent to allow exploration in other national parks. As well, I hope it will allow a number of witnesses to appear before the Standing Committee on the Environment so that concerns can be appropriately addressed and, if necessary, the bill amended so that this special national park reserve can be established. </p>

There is a lot of concern across the country about the provisions that would continue to allow petroleum exploration-related activities within a national park. In particular, there should be no regulatory oversight within a national park by a body such as the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board, whose mandate by legislation includes expanding oil and gas activities. </p>

I know the bill was looked at in the Senate. That is why we have two houses, so that we can have a review of what the other house did. I hope that this bill will have a deep review and not just a cursory review, and that we do not just quickly pass it without consultation.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373097" data-originallang="en">One of the things that we can look at in a positive light is that, importantly, five oil companies that had been granted exploration licences for on-island drilling have voluntarily agreed to relinquish the rights.

We have an island with a nautical mile buffer zone that is totally protected but allows, for instance, Mobil Oil to go on it and monitor wells that were drilled back in the seventies to make sure that the integrity of those wells is maintained. It allows for the helipad on the island. Many national parks have helipads for evacuation purposes, and they have to be maintained. The collaboration of that is a step in the right direction, not just for Sable Island, but for other national parks.</p>

I know the member was not here at that time.

My own private member's bill was passed in the House of Commons and stuck in the Senate, but that is because of the Conservative-dominated Senate and the fact that its members were not able to fulfill their role as parliamentarians. It is very shameful. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373104" data-originallang="en">However, in this situation, we had a case where the Conservatives tabled a bill and the Liberal senators on the committee were able to present amendments.

	<p data-HoCid="3373105" data-originallang="en">Maybe the member is older than I am, but in the 1990s I remember Conservative governments overspending money.

This was evident to my colleagues on the justice and human rights committee when my constituents appeared as witnesses and recounted this horrendous ordeal.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373143" data-originallang="en"> In addition to the support of my colleagues, I would also like to specifically thank the <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="105824" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=105824&amp;Language=E">Minister of Justice</a>'s staff and his department for the support that they have extended to me for my proposed amendment. I am also no less grateful for the support that I have received from serving and retired police officers, including our Conservative law enforcement caucus.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373144" data-originallang="en"> Thousands of officers enforce Canadian criminal law every day, putting their lives on the line to do so. For our men and women in uniform, there may be times when some are reluctant to express judgment on proposed legislation because their job is to enforce, not to legislate. However, in this case, I am grateful for the positive feedback that I have received from police officers. They understand that my amendment does not seek to affect enforcement of section 130 of the Criminal Code. It is a sentencing provision. However, from their perspective, the police I have consulted with recognize that this particular crime jeopardizes their public reputation, which is essential for them to be able to do their jobs.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373145" data-originallang="en">I want to be clear that I understand the significance of amending the Criminal Code. The changes that we as parliamentarians make to the laws found within Canada's Criminal Code have a profound effect on people's lives. However, as parliamentarians, we should also remember that the Criminal Code of Canada is a working document. It must continue to be updated to reflect the protections and justice that Canadians need and expect, and that our freedoms depend on.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373146" data-originallang="en">I am proud to be part of a government that has been so committed to respecting the rights of victims. There are plenty of important issues that we tackle every day for Canadians, but I am especially proud of the accomplishments that our <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="78738" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=78738&amp;Language=E">Prime Minister</a> has delivered to Canadians in reforming our justice system.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373147" data-originallang="en">I represent an area of Canada that has no tolerance for those who commit crimes against either persons or property. The citizens that I represent support a tough justice system that includes incarceration to punish criminals and to protect law-abiding Canadians. When an offender personates a police officer as a cover to commit another crime, this is a severe instance of personating an officer. It can have serious and long-lasting effects on a victim. Victims must be assured that there will be consequences for criminals who have hurt them. The sentence for this kind of malicious deceit must denounce this unlawful conduct and also reflect the significant impact that the crime has on victims' lives. It is not only the victim that this crime affects. It can affect an entire community, even to the extent that people are fearful of real police.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373148" data-originallang="en"> We have seen recent media reports from Calgary of a vehicle driven by a person who is trying to pull people over, with flashing red and blue emergency lights on its dashboard. This is an ongoing mystery in Calgary, as there have been a number of reports of this happening over the past few years but no arrests have yet been made. The Calgary police have issued numerous warnings to motorists to use caution if they are unsure of the authenticity of a police car.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373149" data-originallang="en">The <em>Calgary Sun</em> recently reported, on April 25, that Staff Sergeant Guy Baker said the police are concerned about public paranoia and a loss of trust in police if the culprits are not caught. He was quoted as saying:</p>
	<blockquote><p data-HoCid="3373150" data-originallang="en"> We want to maintain the respect of the community and don’t want the public unduly harassed. </p>
	</blockquote><p data-HoCid="3373151" data-originallang="en">This is a crime that could have grave consequences for an entire community and the police who try to protect it. Therefore, sentences that are handed down for section 130 offences should reflect the seriousness of the crime.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373152" data-originallang="en">Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="5580878" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=5580878&amp;Language=E">C-444</a> has one basic objective, to make personating a peace officer or public officer in the commission of another offence an aggravating circumstance that would be part of the consideration for sentencing purposes.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373153" data-originallang="en"> It would add one clause to the Criminal Code, following section 130, to say:</p>
	<blockquote><p data-HoCid="3373154" data-originallang="en"> If a person is convicted of an offence under section 130, the court imposing the sentence on the person shall consider as an aggravating circumstance the fact that the accused personated a peace officer or a public officer, as the case may be, for the purpose of facilitating the commission of another offence. </p>
	</blockquote><p data-HoCid="3373155" data-originallang="en">When we look at some of the aggravating circumstances that currently exist in the code, there is a common denominator among them, the vulnerability of the victims: crimes against children, crimes against the elderly, crimes involving firearms, or crimes that abuse the position of trust or authority in relation to the victim. These are all circumstances that Parliament has required judges to consider when sentencing. They are legislated as aggravating circumstances because offenders have taken advantage of the vulnerable position that the victims are in.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373156" data-originallang="en">When citizens see a police uniform, they trust the authority that comes with it. When confronted by someone who looks like a police officer, people will rationally do what they have been taught to do; they will stop and follow instructions.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373157" data-originallang="en">Personating an officer is a serious breach of the public's trust, and it has the same effect as using a weapon. It forces the victim to submit. If they are under the control of someone pretending to be an officer, they will ultimately lose any opportunity that they might otherwise have to protect themselves. We have been taught to respect and trust the men and women who wear uniforms. When criminals start using this trust as a weapon, we need to treat it within the Criminal Code for what it is.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373158" data-originallang="en">The bill will instruct judges to consider it an aggravating circumstance to personate a peace officer or public officer as a cover for other criminal activity. This would apply regardless of the age of the victim.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373159" data-originallang="en">My amendment would achieve three results. It will recognize the disarming effect that personating an officer has on a victim and the vulnerable situation that it puts them in. It will support victims of this crime by strengthening the reparation provided to them. It will preserve the trust that Canadians have in peace officers and public officers.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373160" data-originallang="en">Within the maximum sentence for personating an officer, the appropriateness of a sentence would still rest with the sentencing court. However, it is up to us, as legislators, to establish sentencing provisions in the Criminal Code.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373161" data-originallang="en"> Judges have the discretion to consider any factors they feel may have constituted aggression on the part of an offender, but there are also some circumstances that judges are explicitly required to consider when sentencing. They are in the code because Parliament has said they should always be taken into consideration by a judge.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373162" data-originallang="en">As I have mentioned, one of the aggravating circumstances prescribed in the code is that of an abuse of a position of trust or authority in relation to a victim. This would apply in situations where an offender has an existing relationship with the victim, such as a teacher or coach or as a bona fide police officer. However, those who assume a position through deceit do not fall into this category. Offenders who personate officers have not abused a position of authority, for they do not have that position to begin with.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373163" data-originallang="en">Aggravating circumstances in the code acknowledge the particularly forceful or dangerous way in which some offenders commit their crimes. Therefore, personating an officer to commit a crime is certainly an aggressive action on the part of an offender, similar to existing aggravating circumstances, and it should be recognized in the code as such.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373164" data-originallang="en">I would like to quickly address the issue of my amendment having any effect on actual time served. I know this is a question that has come up in debate, as well as in my conversations with some of my colleagues.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373165" data-originallang="en">I want to stress that my focus is on amending section 130 to add this sentencing provision, regardless of the length of sentences received for other convictions and whether or not they would be served concurrently. We can only speculate on what type of crimes may be committed alongside section 130 violations; how individual cases would be committed, tried and sentenced; how much evidence the Crown may have in any particular case; or all of the mitigating or aggravating factors that may affect an offender's sentences. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373166" data-originallang="en">However, our role as legislators is to ensure that the maximum sentences and sentencing factors prescribed in the Criminal Code for each offence serve the purpose and principles of sentencing.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373167" data-originallang="en">I am asking Parliament to add a sentencing provision to the crime of personating peace officers and public officers to ensure that future sentences for this crime adhere to the purposes and principles of sentencing, which are listed in the code. As for the types of crimes that are committed in concert with personation, what aggravating or mitigating factors might apply to an offender, or how an offender's total time served might pan out, those decisions remain in the hands of the sentencing court.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373168" data-originallang="en">Speaking briefly to incarceration, it is meant to denounce unlawful conduct, deter others from committing offences, separate offenders from society and assist in rehabilitating offenders. These are all listed in the Criminal Code as purposes of sentencing. There is also another purpose of incarceration that is listed in the code, which is to provide reparations for harm done to victims or the community.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373169" data-originallang="en">Whatever the terms of a sentence for any offender may be, even if served concurrently with another sentence it is my goal to ensure that sentences for section 130 offences acknowledge the harm done to victims. The rights of victims need to be protected. They must know that there are serious consequences for the criminals who have hurt them.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373170" data-originallang="en">Last weekend, I had the privilege of attending the Sylvan Lake RCMP detachment's Regimental Ball, which was an excellent event that raised funds for the RCMP's victim services program. The people who work in victim service programs and rape crisis centres provide compassion and direction to people in need. When I relayed the circumstances of this case and the purpose of my bill to RCMP members and victim service program attendees, they too gave me their unqualified support.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373171" data-originallang="en">These people, these great Canadians who work in victim service programs, deserve our thanks and recognition. Day in and day out, they see the worst that society has to offer, and they continue to help people in their time of distress. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373172" data-originallang="en">At any time, any one of us could be blindsided by crime. It is very difficult to navigate and make decisions when in a state of shock. Victims services are a vital resource in our country, and they deserve our recognition and support. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373173" data-originallang="en">For many victims, no amount of incarceration can ever make up for the hurt that has been inflicted upon them, but it does provide some comfort and indeed protection when an offender is locked up. As I have said, this bill is about sentencing; it speaks to the need for tougher penalties for this particular crime. Victims must be assured that there will be serious consequences for the criminals who have hurt them. We need to preserve the trust and respect that citizens have for real police officers. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373174" data-originallang="en">I am pleased to continue this discussion here today.</p>

This bill is a model of a logical and balanced approached to justice that we can stand behind and support.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373176" data-originallang="en">It is a good example for democracy. It shows Canadians that sometimes we can work together in the House to produce good legislation.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373177" data-originallang="en">Does the member realize that if they continue in this way of working—a reasonable and mannered approach, listening to opposition comments and working together, rather than in an adversarial approach—that perhaps we could pass other pieces of legislation? </p>
	</div>

Truly, this was an opportunity that I had. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373179" data-originallang="en">It was a little over three years ago when I first got an email from the family. We set up a meeting and we were going from there. There are a couple of things from that particular email that I would like to share, if I may. It said:</p>
	<blockquote><p data-HoCid="3373180" data-originallang="en"> I am asking you...[to] meet with me, so that we can move forward with a legislation change federally to increase the sentences for persons who impersonate a police officer in order to commit a crime. It is an abuse of public trust. It is abhorrent. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373181" data-originallang="en"> We teach our children to listen to the police. My daughter did what she's been taught, and suffers every hour of every day for it. I need some help to know what steps to take and where to go. </p>
	</blockquote><p data-HoCid="3373182" data-originallang="en">This opportunity we have in the House of Commons and the opportunity I had as a private member with this bill, and the three years it has taken to get to this particular stage, is something I am proud of. I appreciate the support that I have had from all members of the House. </p>
	</div>
<div class="statement" data-bill-stage="C-444,3" data-h1="Private Members' Business" data-h2="Criminal Code" data-intervention-type="Question" data-person-speaking-HoCid="170315" data-person-speaking-attribution="Ms. Jean Crowder (Nanaimo—Cowichan, NDP)" data-timestamp="2013-05-31 13:45:00" id="8050708"><p data-HoCid="3373183" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for bringing the bill forward. As he mentioned in his speech, he has brought it forward a number of times. The NDP will be supporting it and this is one of those rare moments in the House where we can work together.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373184" data-originallang="en">I know he mentioned this in his speech, but I would like him to address this because it is an important aspect of the bill. Part of this is really about protecting our police forces and their reputations. I will touch on it in my own speech, but I know that it is important for seniors, when an officer presents him or herself at their doorstep, to have some confidence that it is an officer of the law. Although it speaks to sentencing, this particular piece of legislation can be a deterrent. It can protect those reputations and give seniors some confidence that there are consequences to someone impersonating a peace officer.</p>
	</div>
<div class="statement" data-bill-stage="C-444,3" data-h1="Private Members' Business" data-h2="Criminal Code" data-intervention-type="Interjection" data-person-speaking-HoCid="170209" data-person-speaking-attribution="Mr. Earl Dreeshen" data-timestamp="2013-05-31 13:45:00" id="8050711"><p data-HoCid="3373185" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, indeed that is one of the aspects. After I had the opportunity to speak with the family and the young lady involved here, we then talked to the police. We wanted to find out just what some of the concerns were. I will get to the other point in a moment, but in a lot of cases, when police officers are arresting someone there are numerous charges, such as an assault that might take place against the police officer. However, those things kind of get lost in the mix by the time they get to the courts. I think they looked at this as one of those features we could present to the public that would say, this is something that is important. Therefore, if it is an aggravating circumstance we know that it would be addressed. They were interested in that aspect of it.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373186" data-originallang="en">Certainly, if we go through what aggravating circumstances are, the intent is that any type of activity against the elderly or against the young would be involved. What impressed me was that, at the time, this young girl was 16 years old and she knew that the aggravating circumstances aspect of it was related to her age. However, she was saying that everyone has to keep this in mind. For that reason, I am extremely proud of being able to bring the bill forward. </p>

<div class="statement" data-bill-stage="C-444,3" data-h1="Private Members' Business" data-h2="Criminal Code" data-intervention-type="Debate" data-person-speaking-HoCid="170174" data-person-speaking-attribution="Mr. Jamie Nicholls (Vaudreuil—Soulanges, NDP)" data-timestamp="2013-05-31 13:50:00" id="8050714"><p data-HoCid="3373187" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, today I will be talking about Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="5580878" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=5580878&amp;Language=E">C-444, An Act to amend the Criminal Code</a>.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373188" data-originallang="fr">The bill makes a slight amendment to the Criminal Code about personating a police officer or a public officer. This is a change for the better, so the official opposition will support the bill. I am pleased that we can work with the government to pass Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="5580878" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=5580878&amp;Language=E">C-444</a> quickly.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373189" data-originallang="fr">This bill establishes that personating a police officer or a public officer for the purpose of committing another offence must be considered by a court to be an aggravating circumstance.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373190" data-originallang="fr">How does that change the existing law? Currently, personating a police officer is an offence. That will not change. What would change is that the courts would no longer consider personation to be a stand-alone offence. In other words, if this crime is committed for the purpose of committing another offence, it will be considered an aggravating circumstance with respect to the primary offence. Until now, the two offences were considered separately.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373191" data-originallang="fr">Today, if a man is convicted of disguising himself as a police officer for the purpose of committing an assault, the court will hand down separate sentences for the assault and for personating a police officer. This bill will give the judge a way to connect the assault and the personation that enabled the assault. It will be easier for the judge to account for the outcome of personating a public officer. Guilty parties will receive more appropriate sentences.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373192" data-originallang="fr">It seems clear to us that, in such cases, the personation is part of the plan to commit the assault, so it would not make sense to separate the two crimes. I hope that the law will soon reflect logic and common sense.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373193" data-originallang="fr">There is another reason I wholeheartedly support this bill. Like my colleagues, I am pleased to support it because, in addition to its logical approach, Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="5580878" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=5580878&amp;Language=E">C-444</a> is balanced. By that, I mean that it respects judicial independence and sidesteps the trap of mandatory minimum sentences.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373194" data-originallang="fr">Courts will be able to assess sentences once they can consider personation to be an aggravating circumstance. Judges will be able to take all aggravating and attenuating circumstances into account.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373195" data-originallang="fr">We need to remember that each case is different. Legislators must provide the justice system with the means to hand down appropriate sentences. The very principle of minimum sentencing goes against that idea. We are quite pleased that this bill does not propose minimum sentences.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373196" data-originallang="fr">I hope that this bill has helped my colleagues on the other side of the House realize that when the Conservative government presents a reasoned approach to a real issue and proposes sensible solutions, the NDP will work with it to ensure that bills move forward more quickly. I should also say that collaborating on Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="5580878" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=5580878&amp;Language=E">C-444</a> gave us the opportunity to reiterate our support for victims and for those who keep our democratic institutions running.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373197" data-originallang="fr">Our first thought should always be of the victims. In particular, I am thinking about the young girl who was sexually assaulted by a police impersonator in Alberta. There are also drivers who have paid bogus fines and seniors who were scammed by criminals posing as public servants. All of these examples have one thing in common: there was an abuse of the victims' trust.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373198" data-originallang="fr">In each of those cases, the culprits took advantage of that trust in public authority. Thinking they were dealing with a public official, the victims let down their guard. They thought they could trust the person standing before them.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373199" data-originallang="fr">Making the connection between personation and the crime it enables more accurately reflects the reality of the abuse. It gives a better picture of the wrongs the victim has suffered, and that is what is important.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373200" data-originallang="fr">The bill more accurately reflects the abuse by helping us to put ourselves in the victim's shoes and to better understand what he or she went through. This allows us to show respect for victims and to punish offenders more appropriately. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373201" data-originallang="fr">The bill will also make it possible to better protect the integrity of our most fundamental institutions. When people see a police uniform, they tend to trust the person wearing it. Personating a peace officer is a serious breach of the public's trust. This type of false representation also has a negative impact on our institutions, which need the public's trust to operate properly.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373202" data-originallang="fr">We refuse to allow Canadians to lose confidence in our institutions because of the actions of a handful of criminals. By disguising themselves as police officers or public officials in order to commit crimes, these offenders are attacking our institutions. They are tarnishing the reputation of public officials who make it possible for us to live in a society where everyone's rights are respected, including the right to live in safe communities.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373203" data-originallang="fr">By passing this bill today, we will be sending a clear message to anyone who might be tempted to impersonate a police officer or a public officer for the purpose of committing a crime. If they do, they will be punished. The court will take that into account and their sentence will be lengthened as a result. Dissuading criminals from committing crime remains the best way to protect Canadians.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373204" data-originallang="fr">If the bill passes, it will help improve our justice system considerably. It will protect the integrity of our institutions by deterring potential criminals from misappropriating the public authority. It will allow for more appropriate punishments, because the courts will be able to appreciate the circumstances of a crime. Furthermore, it will do greater justice to victims, because the outcome will better reflect what they suffered.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373205" data-originallang="fr">I hope this bill will serve as an example to show that when the Conservatives introduce a bill based on a logical and balanced approach, as is the case with this bill, and it does not impose mandatory minimum sentences, we can work together. This co-operation helps push the bill through the legislative process faster in order to benefit Canadians sooner.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373206" data-originallang="fr">To conclude my speech, I would like to talk briefly about something the hon. member for <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="170209" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=170209&amp;Language=E">Red Deer</a> said. He began his speech by saying that he represents a riding that has no tolerance for those who commit crimes. I sincerely hope the member was not implying that some ridings in this country do tolerate crime. Everyone knows that in all of our ridings, our fellow Canadians do not tolerate it. However, we could also say that there are criminals in every riding.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373207" data-originallang="fr">Honest Canadians want to see parliamentarians working together to pass logical, good legislation. They are disappointed to see that criminal activity exists even here, in the Senate, for example. We need to prove to Canadians that no riding in the country tolerates crime. That is certainly the case in Vaudreuil—Soulanges. My constituents want parliamentarians to protect victims and strengthen our laws. They want us to get truly serious about reducing crime across the country so that we can keep our communities safe and so that they can have faith in their institutions.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373208" data-originallang="fr">We will make sure that all Canadians are safe, from coast to coast to coast.</p>

	<p data-HoCid="3373212" data-originallang="en">The bill deals with the existing offence of personating a peace officer or public officer. Specifically it would make it an aggravating factor on sentencing if the offence of personating a peace officer or public officer was committed for the purpose of facilitating another offence.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373213" data-originallang="en">Prior to 2009, pretending to be a peace officer or public officer was a straightforward summary conviction offence. At that time it carried a maximum of six months in prison, a maximum fine of $5,000 or both.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373214" data-originallang="en">In 2009, this government hybridized the offence and increased the penalty to a maximum of five years when prosecuted on indictment, in former Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="3791389" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=3791389&amp;Language=E">S-4</a>, also known as the identity theft bill. That legislation came into force on January 8, 2010.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373215" data-originallang="en">The maximum sentence of five years reflects the fact that the offence only requires that a person pretend to be a peace officer or public officer. It does not require that they have a specific malicious purpose for doing so or that they accomplish something malicious by doing so.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373216" data-originallang="en">Some people may impersonate the police for the thrill of feeling powerful or for other relatively minor objectives, such as obtaining information or gaining access to a place. Simply pretending to be a peace officer or public officer so that others may believe that person is in fact one, without any other motive, is enough to result in a conviction. Such cases may still be dealt with by way of summary conviction proceedings, based on the Crown prosecutor's assessment of all the relevant circumstances.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373217" data-originallang="en">However, the five-year maximum penalty enacted in 2010 ensures that law enforcement and Crown prosecutors have the tools to appropriately address serious incidents of this behaviour, preserving public confidence in our peace officers and public officers.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373218" data-originallang="en">Police personation can be closely associated with other offences. It can, in fact, be used as a tool to make the commission of other offences easier. Because we live in a society where most citizens are trusting of the police, members of the public may acquiesce to the authority of someone they believe to be a police officer or a public officer. The exploitation of citizens' trust in the police demonstrated by this kind of situation is the most troubling form of offence. It is especially deserving of condemnation by sentencing courts, as well as by Parliament.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373219" data-originallang="en">This is precisely the situation that Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="5580878" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=5580878&amp;Language=E">C-444</a> targets. Bill C-444 would make it a mandatory aggravating factor on sentencing for the crime of personating a peace officer or public officer if the offence was committed for the purpose of facilitating the commission of another offence. It is frightening even to imagine how people could be influenced to comply with directions or the assertion of authority by someone they believed to be a police officer.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373220" data-originallang="en">We are taught from our earliest interactions with our parents and teachers that police officers are safe persons we can rely on, especially in difficult or dangerous situations. It is thus not surprising that the vast majority of Canadians instinctively respect police officers' authority and follow their instructions, as we rightfully believe they are acting to keep us safe.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373221" data-originallang="en">When criminals take advantage of this trust to defraud us or worse, that bond is jeopardized. This not only causes a great deal of anguish for individual survivors of these offences but also acts to make it more difficult for police officers or public officers to do their jobs effectively and keep our communities safe. Fortunately this is a rare occurrence, but its extreme seriousness can justify express condemnation in the Criminal Code.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373222" data-originallang="en">It is also important to recall that in determining a fit sentence, the court must in all cases take into account all relevant aggravating and mitigating factors. Paragraph 718.2(a) of the Criminal Code describes a number of aggravating factors that apply to all offences. These include, for instance, evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim. However in addition to these factors that are specifically listed, the sentencing court always retains discretion to determine if additional circumstances revealed by the evidence are aggravating or mitigating factors that should affect the sentence.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373223" data-originallang="en">It is already the case in our law that a sentencing judge can take into account the aggravating nature of this form of police personation. What Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="5580878" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=5580878&amp;Language=E">C-444</a> would do is essentially codify this practice in the context of the criminal law.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373224" data-originallang="en">Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="5580878" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=5580878&amp;Language=E">C-444</a> merits support because it addresses a truly horrific form of criminality which has so many negative consequences on the public at large, on the ability of the police to carry out their functions, and especially on any individuals whose trust in public institutions and authorities was used against them to facilitate their victimization. There have been a number of incidents of this form of conduct reported in the papers in the last few years. Just this past April it appeared that at least two more incidents of personating peace officers have occurred. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373225" data-originallang="en">In Calgary there are recent media reports that a man driving a silver sedan with unauthorized red and blue lights pulled over two vehicles, scaring the innocent drivers. Fortunately, the victims realized that something was not right about the impostor and got in contact with the real authorities to report the situation. Luckily, nobody was harmed. However, this act has surely shaken Canadians' trust and their belief in who is or is not a police officer.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373226" data-originallang="en">On the east coast, the Halifax <em>Chronicle Herald</em> reported criminals had been personating local police officers via telephone in order to fraudulently solicit donations for a bogus charity. The scam artists claimed that they were police officers fundraising to help combat youth suicide. This disgraceful conduct not only preys on generous citizens, but also makes it more difficult for real officers to give back to their communities through legitimate fundraising activities, which is a long-standing tradition in police services across our country.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373227" data-originallang="en">Of course, there was the tragic case in the sponsoring member's riding, which saw a devastating abduction and sexual assault of a teenage girl near Penhold, Alberta. This incident clearly influenced the proponent's decision to bring this legislation forward.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373228" data-originallang="en">During the most recent committee study of the bill, members heard the courageous testimony of the survivor of that offence as well as that of her mother. I applaud the immense strength of that young woman's courage to travel to Ottawa and assist the committee by sharing her story with members of Parliament as well as with all Canadians. She rightly explained to the committee that there should never be shame or stigma in reporting or speaking out against sexual violence. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373229" data-originallang="en">By passing this legislation we would send a clear message that the courts must give serious weight during sentencing to the enduring harm that is caused when criminals personate police officers or public officers for the purpose of committing other criminal acts, including sexual assault and kidnapping.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373230" data-originallang="en">All Canadians should be concerned about these cases and should be encouraged to take the appropriate steps to avoid being duped by this very deceptive form of criminality. In particular, citizens should continue to trust the police but they should also recognize that criminals are not above exploiting their trust.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373231" data-originallang="en">It is a difficult balance to achieve. The exercise of a bit of caution is a good thing. It is reasonable to ask to see the badges of individuals who appears to be police officers, especially if being requested to go with them or to allow them to enter the premises, or if they appear to be soliciting donations. This kind of verification process must be done respectfully and cautiously. If an impostor flees when asked for identification, immediately call 911, report the incident and attempt to provide an accurate description of the person and any associated vehicle while the encounter is still fresh in memory.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373232" data-originallang="en">We as parliamentarians can help educate and inform Canadians about these risks, which many may be unaware of. In terms of Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="5580878" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=5580878&amp;Language=E">C-444</a>, we can also vote to support this legislation and express our unified condemnation of those who would use our best natures as citizens against us.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373233" data-originallang="en">I hope all members will join me in supporting this worthwhile legislation.</p>

<div class="statement" data-bill-stage="C-444,3" data-h1="Private Members' Business" data-h2="Criminal Code" data-intervention-type="Debate" data-person-speaking-HoCid="170215" data-person-speaking-attribution="Mr. Denis Blanchette (Louis-Hébert, NDP)" data-timestamp="2013-05-31 14:10:00" id="8050771"><p data-HoCid="3373234" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House to speak to Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="5580878" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=5580878&amp;Language=E">C-444</a>.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373235" data-originallang="fr">I will begin by quoting Anne Frank: “How wonderful it is that nobody need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world.” I think this resonates with the hon. member for <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="170209" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=170209&amp;Language=E">Red Deer</a>, who has had to wait three years to get to third reading stage of his bill. In fact, this is a reincarnation of a bill that unfortunately died on the order paper. Such is life.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373236" data-originallang="fr">I want to commend the hon. member for <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="170209" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=170209&amp;Language=E">Red Deer</a> on resisting the urge to suggest a minimum sentence. He took another approach in considering personating an officer an aggravating factor in the crime committed, for the purpose of sentencing. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373237" data-originallang="fr">This is a wise approach. It respects judicial independence and it suits the opposition. It shows that we can achieve rapid success if things are done properly. I thank him for that.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373238" data-originallang="fr">By taking this approach we are showing victims that during the trial, the courts will take into consideration the circumstances in which the crime was committed. That is important because the appearance of justice is just as important as justice itself. For these victims, it is very important to take into consideration the way in which the crime was committed, as well as their story, as painful as it may be. We have to take that into account.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373239" data-originallang="fr">This bill will help prevent people from mistrusting peace officers, something that should never happen. This is not insignificant. In terms of prevention, this is important.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373240" data-originallang="fr">When someone personates an officer, they make others vulnerable. Someone who personates an officer and takes advantage might put someone else who is not necessarily a victim in a vulnerable position. When we trust people, we lower our guard. It is human nature and that is good.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373241" data-originallang="fr">Taking advantage of this vulnerability is absolutely wrong. I think everyone here, on both sides of the House, agrees on that. In many cases people actively try to make others vulnerable. Much has been said about naturally vulnerable people, such as young children and the elderly. Everyone intuitively understands that. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373242" data-originallang="fr">However, some people can exploit the vulnerability of others for their own benefit through lying or misrepresentation. Bullying is a typical case. Someone uses a supposedly superior position to achieve certain ends. Whether it involves physical or psychological abuse, bullying is bullying regardless of the individual or group of people targeted.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373243" data-originallang="fr">People who use their knowledge of the law, for example, to take advantage of others who do not have this knowledge are also doing something reprehensible. This human failing can take several forms.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373244" data-originallang="fr"> Let me tell you about something that happened to me once. I was walking my dog outside. There were some homeless people not far from my house.These were people without much of a future and who did not have a lot in life. I saw a homeless person talking to someone, almost as poor, who was offering a warm place to sleep for one night. In return, this individual was asking the homeless person sleeping on the street to give up the only thing he had, which was a watch. When I saw that, I was absolutely shocked.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373245" data-originallang="fr">Continually trying to exploit a weakness, whatever it is, for example through personation, as addressed in the bill, is something that always infuriates me because everyone deserves respect.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373246" data-originallang="fr">I would like to tell the member for <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="170209" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=170209&amp;Language=E">Red Deer</a> that I really appreciate his approach. I really appreciate the example he sets for the entire House on how to work together, as my colleague from <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="170174" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=170174&amp;Language=E">Vaudreuil-Soulanges</a> mentioned. He went about it in a way that made it possible for everyone to agree. He makes it possible for us to say that if people of good will sit down together to acknowledge an obvious problem, there are ways to solve it without discord and still advance the ideals of justice. I would like to thank him again for that.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373247" data-originallang="fr">In closing, I hope that the Conservatives are prepared to consider not including minimum sentences in their future bills. In the past, and since I became a member of the House, we have opposed bills or expressed serious reservations about certain bills, not because they were not good bills in their own right, but because they did not recognize the autonomy of judges.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373248" data-originallang="fr">The member for <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="170209" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=170209&amp;Language=E">Red Deer</a> took this into account in this bill and that is important. For that reason, I am pleased to support this bill. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373249" data-originallang="fr">In closing, I would like to quote the <em>Tao Teh Ching</em>. I hope the member for Red Deer will like it. It says that one can “accomplish great things by taking a series of little steps”.<a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="170209" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=170209&amp;Language=E"></a></p>

<div class="statement" data-bill-stage="C-444,3" data-h1="Private Members' Business" data-h2="Criminal Code" data-intervention-type="Debate" data-person-speaking-HoCid="170211" data-person-speaking-attribution="Hon. Irwin Cotler (Mount Royal, Lib.)" data-timestamp="2013-05-31 14:15:00" id="8050787"><p data-HoCid="3373250" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by once again thanking the member for <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="170209" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=170209&amp;Language=E">Red Deer</a> for the work he has done to bring the issue of the personation of peace officers to the attention of the House. As he and others have correctly pointed out, there have been a number of offences committed in recent years in which the offender personated an officer in order to facilitate illegal activity, and these instances have the profoundly troubling consequence of undermining public trust in the police and other officials.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373251" data-originallang="en">I would also like to acknowledge the courageous appearance before the justice committee of Laurie Long and her daughter Jordan, whose 46-hour ordeal at the hands of a man who pretended to be a police officer evokes in all of us the utmost compassion and outrage. Jordan's determination to not only overcome this trauma but to speak openly about it in an effort both to encourage other victims to come forward and to prevent others from being victimized truly merits the term “heroic”.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373252" data-originallang="en">Accordingly, I will be supporting Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="5580878" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=5580878&amp;Language=E">C-444</a> as a statement of the seriousness with which Parliament regards the crime of personation. I can support it because the member for <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="170209" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=170209&amp;Language=E">Red Deer</a> has wisely not included a mandatory minimum sentencing provision and, as such, this legislation would be unlikely to have the unintended negative consequences of other Conservative justice bills that have come before us.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373253" data-originallang="en">However, at the same time the bill is unlikely to have the meaningful positive impact that we all desire, indeed, that which the member for <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="170209" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=170209&amp;Language=E">Red Deer</a> desires, mainly fewer instances of personation. The bill would establish that for offenders who personate a peace officer in order to facilitate another offence, this intention would be considered an aggravating factor with respect to the sentence for personation, yet, as I outlined at second reading, Canada already allows for longer sentences for personation than many comparable jurisdictions, and there has been no suggestion that Canadian judges have been ignoring material aggravating factors when meting them out.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373254" data-originallang="en">Furthermore, even if some judges were moved by this legislation to issue longer sentences than they otherwise would have, the offenders would still be unlikely to spend more time in prison because the sentence for personation would generally be served concurrently with a longer sentence for the crime it was intended to facilitate. Indeed, while the member for <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="170209" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=170209&amp;Language=E">Red Deer</a> outlined at committee certain exceptional hypothetical scenarios in which his bill could conceivably impact the length of a prison term, these scenarios constitute exceptions that prove the rule, which is that the bill will have less of the impact than the member for <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="170209" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=170209&amp;Language=E">Red Deer</a> would himself wish on sentencing and prison terms. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373255" data-originallang="en">Finally, even if this bill were in rare cases to cause certain offenders to spend more time in prison, it has been well established that longer prison terms do not result in less crime. As such, the goal of reducing the occurrence of personation would not be furthered in any event. As I suggested at second reading, preventive measures, such as restricting the availability of authentic looking police attire and equipment, would do more to protect Canadians than this somewhat less than consequential amendment on the matter of sentencing guidelines might do.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373256" data-originallang="en">I know that the member for <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="170209" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=170209&amp;Language=E">Red Deer</a> explained at committee, and today, that his primary purpose in bringing this bill forward was not to increase the length of prison terms, or even to have a direct impact on the incidence of this offence, but rather to raise awareness about the crime of personation. This is a laudable objective, and in fact I have spent much of my own work seeking to raise awareness on various issues, including crimes committed both in Canada and abroad.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373257" data-originallang="en">While I am on the topic, I will take this opportunity to extend my appreciation to those members from all parties who have participated in the context of Iran accountability week in efforts to raise awareness about the threat posed by the Iranian regime, both to other countries and particularly to its own people. Raising awareness can undoubtedly be an important first step on the road to tangible change.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373258" data-originallang="en">However, the Criminal Code is an inappropriate tool with which to engage in an awareness campaign. For one thing, I am somewhat uneasy about the precedent of making additions to it that are primarily of a symbolic nature. The Criminal Code functions best when it is simple, efficient, clear and accessible to ordinary Canadians. Amendments to the Code are appropriate when it is determined that there is a fault or a gap in the law, but if we make a habit or a practice of amending it simply for the purpose of signalling concern, however valid a given concern might be— and, again, I applaud the member for <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="170209" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=170209&amp;Language=E">Red Deer</a> in his expression of concern—we risk unnecessarily complicating a document that is already dense and complex, not to mention risking unforeseen and undesired consequences in unforeseeable cases.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373259" data-originallang="en">More importantly, perhaps, the Criminal Code is simply not an effective means of raising awareness. I appreciate that this bill has brought the matter of personation of peace officers to the attention of Parliament, although that goal could have been achieved just as well by way of a motion. However, surely we must seek not only to alert parliamentarians to this problem, but the Canadian public as well. To that end, adding an aggravating sentencing factor to the Criminal Code, especially one that is unlikely to have any real consequential effect, may achieve little, as very few Canadians are conversant in the sentencing guidelines of section 130.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373260" data-originallang="en">Indeed, the government itself has acknowledged on several occasions that amending the Codes does not, on its own, raise awareness. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373261" data-originallang="en">Last fall, for example, Parliament unanimously passed Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="5452728" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=5452728&amp;Language=E">C-36</a> which, similarly to the bill before us, added an aggravating sentencing factor, this one designed to increase penalties for those who target seniors.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373262" data-originallang="en">At that time, the <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="170868" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=170868&amp;Language=E">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice</a> stood in this House and said:</p>
	<blockquote><p data-HoCid="3373263" data-originallang="en"> This government recognizes the concern expressed by witnesses...who noted that Bill C-36 could not serve as the only response to the problem of elder abuse. </p>
	</blockquote><p data-HoCid="3373264" data-originallang="en">He went on to explain that the bill was intended to complement an awareness and advertising campaign already in place.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373265" data-originallang="en">Another example is Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="5254650" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=5254650&amp;Language=E">C-26</a>, the citizen's arrest and self-defence act, which received royal assent on June 28 of last year. At committee, Catherine Kane, who was then director general and senior general counsel of the criminal law policy and amendments section in the Department of Justice, and I congratulate her on her appointment since to the Federal Court, referred to the government's plan for educating the public regarding the bill's provisions saying, “we will also be embarking on some public education materials so we can explain to various audiences what these changes mean”.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373266" data-originallang="en">I regret that I have yet to see any such educational materials in the 11 months since the bill received royal assent. I might add, parenthetically, that while a backgrounder published by the Department of Justice in conjunction with the coming into force of the legislation on March 11 of this year speaks of two guides on the department's website, “What you need to know about making a citizen's arrest” and “Technical guide to self defence and defence of property reforms”, the links to both are broken.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373267" data-originallang="en">Nevertheless, my point is that even the government has in word, if not always in deed, recognized that education and raising awareness should be conducted outside the Criminal Code. Regrettably, the bill before us does not do likewise. There has been no mention, for instance, of education programs to inform individuals about their right to ask a police officer for identification. Indeed, there has not even been any suggestion that the very change wrought by the bill will be publicized in any way.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373268" data-originallang="en">Simply having this provision rest as one of many in the Criminal Code that most Canadians only encounter when they are either charged with a crime or fall victim to one does not constitute effective education or awareness-raising, and neither is it a strategy that will prevent, deter or dissuade anyone from engaging in what we all agree is reprehensible behaviour.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373269" data-originallang="en">Fundamentally, the 2,074 pages of legal language in the Criminal Code are neither a billboard nor a public service announcement. Any attempt to use them as such, however well intentioned, cannot be expected to succeed.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373270" data-originallang="en">As I said at the outset, I will support this bill so as to join with the member for <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="170209" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=170209&amp;Language=E">Red Deer</a> in seeking to make this statement on an important issue. Again, I commend the member for this initiative. However, if we are to protect Canadians from those who would abuse their trust by disguising themselves as peace officers in order to do harm, we must devise concrete measures that can be more effective at both raising awareness and preventing this intolerable crime.</p>

<div class="statement" data-bill-stage="C-444,3" data-h1="Private Members' Business" data-h2="Criminal Code" data-intervention-type="Debate" data-person-speaking-HoCid="170315" data-person-speaking-attribution="Ms. Jean Crowder (Nanaimo—Cowichan, NDP)" data-timestamp="2013-05-31 14:25:00" id="8050821"><p data-HoCid="3373272" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by acknowledging that New Democrats will be supporting this private member's bill. I want to commend the member for <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="170209" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=170209&amp;Language=E">Red Deer</a> for being so persistent in bringing it forward. I know he has worked on it for a number of years. I also think it speaks to the fact that we as parliamentarians do respond to our constituents. My understanding is that the member for Red Deer brought this forward as a result of an incident in his riding.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373273" data-originallang="en">Others have mentioned it, but what Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="5580878" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=5580878&amp;Language=E">C-444</a> does is to propose to amend article 130 of the Criminal Code, to establish that personating a police officer or public officer for the purposes of committing another offence must be considered by a court to be an aggravating circumstance for sentencing purposes. A number of other members have pointed this out, but I think it bears repeating. It is essential that the public have absolute confidence and are able to trust that when dealing with a police officer, the person is actually a police officer.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373274" data-originallang="en">Many of us, as parents, have told our children that if they are in trouble or get lost when they are out and about, they should go to a police officer. We need to have confidence that it is police officers we are sending our children to.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373275" data-originallang="en">One reason that confidence and trust is important is the fact that we have vulnerable populations. I know the member for <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="170209" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=170209&amp;Language=E">Red Deer</a> specifically talked about a young girl. I also want to touch on seniors because my riding of Nanaimo—Cowichan has a higher than provincial average of seniors. It is a very popular place for people to retire to. Sometimes seniors end up becoming part of the vulnerable population because people who have less than honourable intentions target them specifically for criminal activities. Unfortunately, people personating police officers go to their doors.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373276" data-originallang="en">I went to the Vancouver Police Department's website and read its tips for seniors when dealing with people at the door. The website pointed out that for most crimes, seniors are the least victimized, so I would reassure seniors that they are not often a major target for criminal activity. However, it adversely affects seniors in a way that does not affect others in the population because seniors are often on a fixed income and have much greater difficulty replacing money or property when they have been targeted for criminal activity. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="3373277" data-originallang="en">There are a couple of tips that the Vancouver Police Department suggest. When someone goes to a senior's door, the first thing they should do is to look through the peephole or a glass window that may be on the side of the door to verify who is on the doorstep. If it is somebody purporting to be a police officer and they have any discomfort at all, they should call 911 or contact the police department to verify he or she is actually an officer. </p>
