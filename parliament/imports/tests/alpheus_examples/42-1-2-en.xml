              <ParaText id="4170577">I have the honour to inform the House that when this House did attend His Excellency this day in the Senate chamber, His Excellency was pleased to make a speech to both Houses of Parliament. To prevent mistakes, I have obtained a copy, which is as follows:</ParaText>
            </Content>
          </Intervention>
          <ParaText id="4170578">
            <I>Honourable Senators,
</I>
          </ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170579">
            <I>Members of the House of Commons,
</I>
          </ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170580">
            <I>Ladies and gentlemen,
</I>
          </ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170581">As the representative of Her Majesty The Queen, I am pleased to be here to deliver the Speech from the Throne.</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170582">
A warm welcome to those of you who are returning to your duties as parliamentarians, including those who are returning after an absence.  Know that your experience is valued.  
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170583">Welcome also to the 197 members who are newly elected.  Your enthusiasm and fresh ideas will serve your country well.</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170584">  
I call on all parliamentarians to work together, with a renewed spirit of innovation, openness and collaboration. 
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170585">As governor general, I have seen first-hand what a great country Canada is—from coast to coast to coast.
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170586">And I also know this: We can be even better. 
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170587">How?
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170588">By being smart, and caring—on a scale as never before.</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170589">
The times we live in demand nothing less. 
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170590">Canada succeeds in large part because here, diverse perspectives and different opinions are celebrated, not silenced. 
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170591">Parliament shall be no exception.  
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170592">In this Parliament, all members will be honoured, respected and heard, wherever they sit.  For here, in these chambers, the voices of all Canadians matter.
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170593">Let us not forget, however, that Canadians have been clear and unambiguous in their desire for real change.  Canadians want their government to do different things, and to do things differently.
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170594">They want to be able to trust their government.  
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170595">And they want leadership that is focused on the things that matter most to them.  
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170596">Things like growing the economy; creating jobs; strengthening the middle class, and helping those working hard to join it.
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170597">Through careful consideration and respectful conduct, the Government can meet these challenges, and all others brought before it. 
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170598">By working together in the service of all Canadians, the Government can make real change happen.
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170599">It will do so in the following ways.
<ForceColumnBreak /></ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170600">
            <B>GROWTH FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS</B>
          </ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170601">First and foremost, the Government believes that all Canadians should have a real and fair chance to succeed.  Central to that success is a strong and growing middle class.
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170602">The Government will, as an immediate priority, deliver a tax cut for the middle class.  
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170603">This is the fair thing to do, and the smart thing to do for Canada’s economy. 
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170604">The Government has also committed to provide more direct help to those who need it by giving less to those who do not.  The new Canada Child Benefit will do just that.
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170605">And recognizing that public investment is needed to create and support economic growth, job creation and economic prosperity, the Government will make significant new investments in public transit, green infrastructure, and social infrastructure.
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170606">To give Canadians a more secure retirement, the Government will work with the provinces and territories to enhance the Canada Pension Plan.
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170607">The Employment Insurance system will be strengthened to make sure that it best serves both the Canadian economy and all Canadians who need it.
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170608">To create more opportunities for young Canadians, especially those from low- and 
middle-income families, the Government will work with the provinces and territories to make post-secondary education more affordable.
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170609">And to support the health and well-being of all Canadians, the Government will begin work with the provinces and territories to develop a new Health Accord.
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170610">The Government will undertake these and other initiatives while pursuing a fiscal plan that is responsible, transparent and suited to challenging economic times. 
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170611">
            <B>OPEN AND TRANSPARENT GOVERNMENT</B>
          </ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170612">Second, the Government is committed to open and transparent government.</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170613">
The trust Canadians have in public institutions—including Parliament—has, at times, been compromised. By working with greater openness and transparency, Parliament can restore it. 
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170614">To make sure that every vote counts, the Government will undertake consultations on electoral reform, and will take action to ensure that 2015 will be the last federal election conducted under the first-past-the-post voting system.</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170615">
To restore public trust and bring an end to partisanship, the Government will follow through on its commitment to reform the Senate by creating a new, non-partisan, merit-based process to advise the Prime Minister on Senate appointments.
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170616">And to give Canadians a stronger voice in the House of Commons, the Government will promote more open debate and free votes, and reform and strengthen committees.
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170617">Also notable are the things the Government will not do: it will not use government ads for partisan purposes; it will not interfere with the work of parliamentary officers; and it will not resort to devices like prorogation and omnibus bills to avoid scrutiny.
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170618">
            <B>A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT AND A STRONG ECONOMY</B>
          </ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170619">Third, the Government will prove to Canadians and to the world that a clean environment and a strong economy go hand in hand.  We cannot have one without the other.
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170620">Protecting the environment and growing the economy are not incompatible goals; in fact, our future success demands that we do both. 
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170621">Last week, first ministers met ahead of the international climate change talks—a first step in an important and ongoing process.
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170622">Working together, the Government will continue to provide leadership as Canada works toward putting a price on carbon and reducing carbon pollution.</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170623">
To encourage economic growth, the Government will make strategic investments in clean technology, provide more support for companies seeking to export those technologies, and lead by example in their use.
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170624">And as part of efforts to restore public trust, the Government will introduce new environmental assessment processes.  
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170625">Public input will be sought and considered.  Environmental impacts will be understood and minimized.  Decisions will be informed by scientific evidence.  And Indigenous peoples will be more fully engaged in reviewing and monitoring major resource development projects.
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170626">
            <B>DIVERSITY IS CANADA’S STRENGTH</B>
          </ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170627">Fourth, the Government’s agenda reflects that Canada’s strength is its diversity.</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170628">Canadians elected a government to bring us together, not to set us against one another.  Canada is strong because of our differences, not in spite of them.
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170629">As a country, we are strengthened in many ways: by our shared experiences, by the diversity that inspires both Canada and the world, and by the way that we treat each other.</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170630">
Because it is both the right thing to do and a certain path to economic growth, the Government will undertake to renew, nation-to-nation, the relationship between Canada and Indigenous peoples, one based on recognition of rights, respect, co-operation and partnership.  
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170631">Among other measures, the Government will work co-operatively to implement recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, will launch an inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, and will work with First Nations so that every First Nations child receives a quality education.</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170632">
The Government will make it easier for immigrants to build successful lives in Canada, reunite their families, and contribute to the economic success of all Canadians.
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170633">In response to a pressing international need, and underscored by Canadians’ desire to help, the Government will welcome 25,000 new Canadians from Syria, to arrive in Canada by the end of February 2016.
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170634">In gratitude for the service of Canada’s veterans, the Government will do more to support them and their families.
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170635">The Government will support CBC/Radio-Canada, encourage and promote the use of Canada’s official languages, and invest in Canada’s cultural and creative industries.
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170636">
            <B>SECURITY AND OPPORTUNITY</B>
          </ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170637">Fifth, the Government is committed to providing greater security and opportunity for Canadians.
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170638">Canadians are open, accepting, and generous people.  We know that helping those in need strengthens our communities and makes them safer, more prosperous places to live.</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170639"> 
The Government will strengthen its relationship with allies, especially with our closest friend and partner, the United States.</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170640">
Internationally, the Government will focus its development assistance on helping the world’s poorest and most vulnerable.
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170641">To contribute to greater peace throughout the world, the Government will renew Canada’s commitment to United Nations peacekeeping operations, and will continue to work with its allies in the fight against terrorism.
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170642">To keep Canadians safe and be ready to respond when needed, the Government will launch an open and transparent process to review existing defence capabilities, and will invest in building a leaner, more agile, better-equipped military.
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170643">And to expand economic opportunities for all Canadians, the Government will negotiate beneficial trade agreements, and pursue other opportunities with emerging markets. 
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170644">Recognizing that Canada is, fundamentally, a safe and peaceful country, the Government will continue to work to keep all Canadians safe, while at the same time protecting our cherished rights and freedoms.</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170645">
To that end, the Government will introduce legislation that will provide greater support for survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault; that will get handguns and assault weapons off our streets; and that will legalize, regulate and restrict access to marijuana.
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170646">
            <B>CONCLUSION</B>
          </ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170647">The agenda outlined today is an ambitious one, but it is not one forged in isolation.</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170648">  
Rather, it is the result of conversations with Canadians, who told the Government—plainly and honestly—what they need to be successful.</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170649">
Canadians are confident people.  We know who we are, and we know what kind of country we want to live in.  
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170650">We know the greatness that Canada is capable of, and we know that our success is not only about doing well for ourselves, but also about leaving an even better, more peaceful and prosperous world for our children.
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170651">As you consider the important work that lies ahead, remember that Canadians have placed their trust in you.  It is now your sacred responsibility to help build that better world.</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170652">
By focusing on growing our middle class, on delivering open and transparent government, on ensuring a clean environment and a strong economy, on building a stronger Canada, and on providing greater security and opportunity, the Government will make real change happen.</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170653">
It will prove that better is not only possible—it is the inevitable result when Canadians work together. 
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170654">Members of the House of Commons, you will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry out the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament. 
</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="4170655">Honourable Members of the Senate and Members of the House of Commons, may Divine Providence guide you in your deliberations and make you faithful custodians of the trust bestowed upon you.

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="214108" Type="2">Mr. Rémi Massé (Avignon—La Mitis—Matane—Matapédia, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4170685">Mr. Speaker, I am especially proud to be here in the House today. I would like to thank the people of Avignon—La Mitis—Matane—Matapédia for placing their trust in me and electing me to be their MP. I am very grateful to them and I will work hard to represent all of my constituents during my term in office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4170686"> We promised to bring about real change, and that is exactly what the government is going to do by doing things differently. Canadians want a government that keeps its promises and focuses on the things that matter most to them, things like growing the economy, creating jobs, strengthening the middle class and helping those working hard to join it. Today's throne speech confirmed that we will do just that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4170687">In practical terms, our government will cut taxes for the middle class. It will introduce the Canada child benefit, which will give families more than what they are currently receiving and which will also be tax-free. It will be money that stays in families' pockets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4170688">We will be able to keep these promises because we are asking the richest Canadians to do a little more to help balance the wealth in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4170689"> After a lifetime of hard work, the people of Avignon—La Mitis—Matane—Matapédia and all Canadians deserve a secure and dignified retirement. We will help them reach that goal through a strong and stable retirement income plan. We will work with the provinces and territories, workers, employers, and retiree organizations to enhance the Canada pension plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4170690">We will also restore the eligibility age for old age security and the guaranteed income supplement to 65. We will increase the guaranteed income supplement for single, low-income seniors. That will put more money in their pockets. What is more, we are committed to establishing the seniors price index in order to measure the cost of living for seniors. We also plan to keep pension income splitting for seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4170691">With regard to youth, we plan to get young people involved in government. We will create a Prime Minister’s youth advisory council to provide non-partisan advice to the Prime Minister on issues facing the country. This council will be made up of young Canadians aged 16 to 24 from across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4170692">I have already received a letter from Samuel Perreault, a 16-year-old from Mont-Joli who wants to be part of the council. Samuel, Jonathan, Simon, Gabriel, and Christina, along with other engaged and dynamic youth, worked tirelessly to help us throughout the election campaign. These young men and women are the leaders of tomorrow, and I know that with them, my children—our children—are in good hands. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4170693"> We will also strengthen the employment insurance system to make it more flexible, to provide Canadians with benefits when they really need them, to help people develop the skills they need for their next job, and to ensure that employment insurance reflects our labour market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4170694">We will lower employment insurance premiums to reduce payroll costs for employers and employees. We will reduce the waiting period for employment insurance benefits from two weeks to one. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="00">(1600)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4170695">We will implement higher service standards, including reduced wait times.</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="4170697">The timing has never been more critical: interest rates for new investments are at historic lows; our current infrastructure is aging; and Canada is in immediate need of a boost in economic growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4170698">Each year over the next decade we will steadily increase federal infrastructure investment. We will almost double federal infrastructure investment to nearly $125 billion over 10 years. This will be the largest new investment in infrastructure in Canadian history.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="4170699">Our government will quadruple federal investment in public transit over a period of 10 years. Our funding will respond to what the municipalities need, to ensure that the maximum number of public transit projects are completed in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4170700">Part of the Liberal government's commitment to making an historic investment in social infrastructure is to make affordable housing and seniors' residences a priority. We will also be investing in recreational and cultural infrastructure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4170701">Our plan will spur the construction of more housing and the renovation of existing housing. It will renew existing co-op agreements and provide operational support to municipalities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4170702">We will invest in green infrastructure for projects involving water systems and waste water facilities. We will invest in climate resilient infrastructure, clean energy, and the remediation of contaminated lands for new construction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4170703">We will also be investing in an innovation program. We will provide direct support to incubators and accelerators and research facilities, in addition to providing financing and other support for small companies wanting to grow and export. This funding will also help modernize and strengthen the technology transfer and commercialization functions at universities and colleges.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="4170704">We will invest more annually to create sector-specific strategies that support innovation and clean technologies in the forestry, fisheries, mining, energy, and agricultural sectors. These strategies will be developed in collaboration with the private sector, government, and research institutions with the objective of producing real innovation that can be deployed in our natural resources sectors, and be commercialized, brought to scale, and exported.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4170705">We will invest in clean technology producers so they can tackle Canada's most pressing environmental challenges, whether with respect to our air, our water, or our land. This means we will invest more per year in organizations that have been successful at supporting the emergence of clean technology firms, including Sustainable Development Technology Canada. We will also work in partnership with the private sector to enhance the availability of venture capital for new clean technology.</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="4170707">For instance, we will invest new funding each year in core funding for kindergarten through grade 12 programs. This will include money committed by the previous government that has yet to flow, plus additional incremental funding. Over the next four years this will represent a $2.6 billion new investment in helping first nation students learn and succeed.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="4170708">We will also invest more money in first nations school infrastructure. We will inject more money in the post-secondary student support program.

              <ParaText id="4170710">I never imagined that I would get into politics. That was never one of my goals. I am here today because my riding, <Affiliation DbId="214108" Type="2">Avignon—La Mitis—Matane—Matapédia</Affiliation>, which is in the Gaspé, is facing an extremely difficult economic situation. My region is among the 10 poorest ridings in Canada. My region includes seven of the 10 most disadvantaged cities and towns in Quebec. Our unemployment rate is nearly 17%, and the further east you go, the higher the rate is. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="4170711">In my riding, we have two great Mi'kmaq communities, Listuguj and Gesgapegiag. I thank them for their support, and I say to them <I>wela'lin</I>, which means thank you.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4170712">However, in these communities, the unemployment rate has reached almost 40%.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="4170713">Families are leaving our region because they are having a hard time finding work. They are leaving our beautiful region and moving to large urban centres like Quebec City and Montreal, where they have a better chance of finding a job. Our industries have slowed to a crawl. Our businesses are shutting down on a regular basis and have been doing so for too long now. Family businesses that had operated for 40 years have shut down. We had a fantastic, established bicycle company located downtown, but it no longer exists. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4170714">I got involved in politics to help my region. I worked for the Government of Canada for 17 years, in departments like Justice Canada, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and Health Canada here in the national capital region, as well as Public Works and Government Services Canada in Matane, where I later ran the CEGEP. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4170715">My wife and I have four young boys. I can assure the House that I was not seeking a new challenge or looking for a new job. I truly loved my job, my staff and my students. With my wife Hélène's support, I decided to get involved in politics in order to put my experience and knowledge to work for all our citizens. My riding, the Gaspé and many other regions across Canada like ours need tools and a strong helping hand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4170716">We need to create an environment that will foster the economic development of our region. We need sustainable jobs. We need investments in infrastructure in order to ensure, for example, that the port of Matane is viable in the long term so that we can continue to reap all the benefits of our marine assets; to support the Carleton-sur-Mer wharf overhaul project so that boaters, tourists, and fishers have access to quality infrastructure; and to extend the runway at Mont-Joli airport and decontaminate the land so that it becomes a true regional airport that will support development in the north.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4170717">Since 2006, the number of federal jobs in my riding has dropped by nearly 28%. The two ridings that make up the Gaspé and the Îles-de-la-Madeleine have lost more than 100 jobs, which is equivalent to 1,000 jobs in major centres. Jobs have been lost in New Richmond, Gaspé, Pointe-à-la-Croix, Rivière-au-Renard and Mont-Joli. Here is one example of the impact of these cuts. A resident of Mont-Joli had to drive eight hours to Quebec City this week to ensure that her son's passport was renewed in time to travel in mid-December. This woman had initially submitted the forms by mail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4170718"> They were unfortunately returned because information was missing. She had no choice but to miss a day of work and drive to Quebec City, in December, so that she could get her application fast-tracked at the Passport Canada office. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4170719">This is just one example of how important it is to keep Government of Canada services in the regions. These jobs are important to us. These public servants contribute to our region's economic, social and cultural development. These women and men help employment insurance claimants get their benefits. Workers in the regions digitize documents. These men and women help preserve Canadian archives and make them available. They process all the payments issued by the Government of Canada. They are conscientious, committed, dedicated workers who provide high-quality services to Canadians. These organizations exist because we believed they had potential in the regions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4170720">I would like to create new opportunities to bring back these jobs. I also hope to support the development of various sectors and contribute to them. The government's directions, as set out in the throne speech, are directly connected to my constituents' needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4170721">I have faith in our region, our young people, our artists, our creators, and our entrepreneurs. I have worked hard in recent years. I will continue to work hard in my new role, with the same energy and determination.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4170722">I am proud to be part of this government, and I have faith in it.</ParaText>

It is where my family has chosen to make our home. I know first-hand how vibrant and full of promise the city is. I believe it reflects the true potential of Canada from coast to coast to coast. Brampton embodies the diversity of Canada with its growing population of 600,000, making it Canada's ninth-largest city. It is home to Canadians from various backgrounds, with 50% of its population having been born outside of Canada. More than 65% of Brampton's population are from visible minorities, speaking upwards of 80 different languages, including Punjabi, Portuguese, Urdu, Spanish, Gujarati, Hindi, and so on. Over the last 30 years, I have seen this community time and time again come together and strengthen its diversity in unity. </ParaText>

We will ensure that, like all Canadians, they have a fair and real chance to succeed. It is the Canadian thing to do. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4170769">The development of social infrastructure is the foundation of a strong society. One of our core Canadian values is to take care of those who are vulnerable. In Brampton, the wait time for affordable housing is a shocking 10 years. This is unacceptable, and our government is invested in taking a leadership role to help build more housing units, refurbish existing ones, renew existing co-ops, and provide greater funding to support municipalities. This approach will assist those who need it the most, especially struggling, low-income families, single-parent families, and vulnerable seniors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4170770">To offer greater flexibility in child care needs, we will create the Canada child benefit to put more money back in the pockets of middle-class and low-income families. This will lift 315,000 Canadian children out of poverty. Together with social infrastructure, this will act as a vehicle in uplifting the status of women, along with giving children a head start in life and offering families the flexibility that is needed in the 21st century. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4170772">Just as important as investing in transit and social infrastructure, Canada must plan for the future and invest in green technologies. Canadians share a deep love for the outdoors and a sense of responsibility to protect our environment for future generations. Therefore, we will be working with the provinces to take action on climate change, invest in clean technologies, and create clean jobs.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4170778">We will also work with the provinces and territories to make post-secondary education more affordable, so that it is still possible in a country like ours for people of all socio-economic backgrounds to achieve the Canadian dream to send their sons and daughters to world-renowned schools without taking out a second mortgage, and so that our youth are not discouraged from pursuing higher education and attaining the skills they need to compete in this global economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4170779">His Excellency raised the importance of restoring trust in our political institutions and ensuring that Canadians are given a stronger voice in Parliament. This government is determined to do just that. The year 2015 marks not only the year we have brought in a gender-balanced cabinet, but it will also be the last federal election under the first past the post voting system.</ParaText>
