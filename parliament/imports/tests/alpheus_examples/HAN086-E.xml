							<ParaText id="3720887">Mr. Speaker, last year the Minister of Foreign Affairs asked officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development, or DFATD, to consult with all provinces and territories on the Arms Trade Treaty, after already having consulted with non-governmental organizations, including such diverse groups as Oxfam Canada, Oxfam Quebec, Project Ploughshares, Amnesty International, and the Canadian Shooting Sports Association.

In addition, Canada rigorously assesses all exports of military goods and technology on a case-by-case basis.  In fact, Canada’s controls exceed those of the proposed ATT.</ParaText><ParaText id="3720889">It is important that any treaty should neither affect lawful and responsible firearms owners nor discourage the transfer of firearms for recreational uses such as sport shooting and hunting.

While the benefits and costs cannot be analyzed on an annual basis, PWGSC’s 2007 analysis has concluded that the sale-leaseback of the seven buildings represents the lowest cost and best value to Canada over the term of the investment

Canada is the only G8 country in the world without a national housing strategy, thanks to the Liberals, who downloaded the responsibility for housing to the provinces.</ParaText><ParaText id="3720952">Today, three million Canadians live in housing insecurity due to irresponsible housing policies from successive Liberal and Conservative governments. With a growing number of homeless people and long delays in obtaining access to safe and affordable housing, the government must stop ignoring the problem. The Conservatives' blatant disregard for social housing is creating a critical situation where the need for social housing is increasing at the same time as the quantity of affordable housing is declining.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3720953">In 1993, the federal Liberals took the position that they would not act on the task force that they had so gallantly put forward in 1990. In fact, it is a classic example of the Liberals indicating that they are going to go in one direction and actually going in the exact opposite direction. They took that task force, co-chaired by the esteemed Joe Fontana, and made the suggestion that the Conservatives, who were in power at the time, were cutting social housing and it should be stopped. In fact, they said that more money should have been spent on social housing and affordable housing. However, their first budget cut was $128 million from CMHC's budget, most of which was allocated to affordable housing programs. That was in 1995. In 1996, the Liberals downloaded the responsibility for social housing to the provinces and territories, effectively ending Canada's national affordable housing program.</ParaText><ParaText id="3720954">Canada is the only major industrialized country to not have a national housing strategy.</ParaText><ParaText id="3720955">The Liberals also slashed transfers to the provinces and territories at the same time that they expected them to take on responsibility for this all important program for social and affordable housing. In 1999, the Liberals announced a bit of money for homelessness programs, but as Michael Shapcott of the Wellesly Institute said, “The federal homelessness funding will make homeless more comfortable, but it won't make them any less homeless”.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3720956">Some more money was added in 2002 and 2004, but those agreements and that money did not have any accountability programs. Therefore, the accountability issue regarding the housing money that was being spent meant that although Ontario claimed to have created 46,000 units, after research of the audit was done, only 63 homes had actually been built. There was no accountability for whatever was being spent by the federal government.</ParaText><ParaText id="3720957">In 2005, when the Liberals proposed giving huge tax breaks to corporations, Jack Layton and his NDP colleagues helped to rewrite that budget and divert $4.6 billion in corporate giveaways to important priorities, like affordable housing, training and public transit. It included $1.6 billion for affordable housing construction, including aboriginal housing. This was the first time any real commitment to affordable housing had been made in well over a decade.</ParaText><ParaText id="3720958">Then the Liberals were defeated due to corruption before the funding was fully implemented, but the Conservatives implemented most of that funding. Although the Conservatives voted against it at one point, we still have some of that funding in our supply.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3720959">Meanwhile, the Conservatives, for their part, have now announced they will not be renewing the long-term social housing operating agreements or continuing to invest that funding in affordable housing. Essentially, they see this as a budget line item that they can strike out of the budget, and take $1.7 billion out of affordable housing in our country. That $1.7 billion is currently earmarked for assistance to individuals to meet their rent obligations. When that money disappears, those individuals will effectively become homeless. The Conservatives do not seem to care that those individuals will become homeless as a result of their actions. </ParaText><ParaText id="3720960">About 620,000 households were supported by that $1.7 billion, and as many as 200,000 housing units will be lost due to the loss of operating funds or insufficient capital for much-needed renovations.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="25">(1525)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3720961">Despite what the minister said earlier, these are not all mortgage subsidies. Some of these buildings are leased from other organizations, and when the subsidies end, so ends the rental accommodation support that has been going to seniors and other individuals who really need the support.</ParaText><ParaText id="3720962">An example of this lack of strategy is no more evident than in my home city of Toronto, and in particular in my riding of York South—Weston, where as a result of the lack of investment in social housing over more than two decades, and as a result of the fact that when the federal government downloaded the social housing units to the City of Toronto, they inherited a three-quarters of a billion-dollar fix-it bill for those units. That fix-it bill is now being paid for by the City of Toronto by selling social housing units. They do not have the capital to fix these units, and the government is not forthcoming with money, so it is having to get rid of social housing units to be able to meet the demands for the repairs that are necessary in these units. It is like eating our own seed potatoes, as is said in the Maritimes.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3720963">The city of Toronto is a great example of what the lack of funding for social housing construction really means. There has been virtually no new social housing constructed in the city of Toronto in the past 20 years. As more and more people find it impossible to afford the ever-growing rents and the ever-growing cost of buying a home in Toronto, they are faced with the prospect of seeking social assistance and seeking to be in Toronto community housing buildings. The wait-list has over 90,000 applications on it. That is 170,000 people who are looking for accommodation and support. There are only 90,000 units in the first place, so there are as many people on the wait-list as there are units. The wait-lists in some circumstances are 10 and 12 years long.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3720964"> Individuals have to survive somehow, and they survive by moving into overcrowded units, by moving into units that are poorly maintained, and by moving into units they cannot afford. There are individuals in my riding who are paying 70% and 80% of their income for shelter, because the minimum wage in Ontario is so low. It is $10.25. If people who make minimum wage on a full-time basis have to pay rent at today's market rates in Toronto for a two-bedroom apartment, it is 70% of their earnings, and for a three-bedroom apartment, it is 90%. The 90% figure is completely unaffordable. People could not eat or possibly raise a family spending 90% of their income on housing, yet that is what people face when they are on a waiting list for supported housing that cannot possibly be met. It will be 10 or more years before they ever reach the top of that waiting list.</ParaText><ParaText id="3720965">There was a recent study by the University of Toronto, partly in my riding, that determined that 90% of the individuals who currently live in apartment blocks in Toronto that were built between the fifties and the eighties face homelessness in some measure. One-third of those people, which is thousands upon thousands of people, have a critical risk of homelessness. Those individuals could be homeless almost immediately.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3720966">What does “homeless” mean to people like that? It means finding a shelter, but there are no shelters. It means finding a friend, relative, or neighbour they can bunk with for as long as it takes to find another place to live, but that means they are now in overcrowded housing. That means they are now in housing that is not designed to support as many people as are expected to live in it.</ParaText><ParaText id="3720967">That is another example of why this is a crisis. It is a national crisis. It is not limited to Toronto. All over Canada we have a growing need for affordable housing that we are just unable to meet.</ParaText><ParaText id="3720968">Today the Federation of Canadian Municipalities said it supports the motion and our continued focus on fixing Canada's housing crunch. The president, Claude Dauphin, said he supports my motion and supports our moving forward to ease the burden by immediately renewing long-term social housing funding, reinvesting in the development of affordable housing units, and reinforcing the role of municipalities as key stakeholders in the process.</ParaText>

Representatives of the United Way met with me and told me just how difficult it was for individuals who were living on less than the enormous wages that were being paid in the oil patch to have a place to live. They told me about an individual who was making $18 an hour working at Tim Hortons, but all he could afford was to rent someone's couch for eight hours a day. He did not even have a place to hang his clothes. He rented a couch for $600 a month and could only have access to it between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. each day, because he worked the night shift at Tim Hortons.</ParaText><ParaText id="3720982">That is the kind of housing crunch that exists even in boom places. The price of a home in Fort McMurray is upwards of $900,000. That is unaffordable. The rental crisis has gone crazy with it.

The people in my riding of <Affiliation DbId="170151" Type="2">Hochelaga</Affiliation> often talk to me about this issue, and it should concern every single elected official in the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="3720984">I often say this, but I will say it again: the NDP believes that housing is a right. However, if we are having to debate this motion today, it means that our opinion is not shared by the Conservatives or the Liberals, no matter what they say.</ParaText><ParaText id="3720985">This motion acknowledges the poor decisions made one after the other by previous governments, since 1993 in particular. Of course, I am talking about the Liberals and the Conservatives. These poor decisions resulted in a major housing crisis in Canada, one that is unprecedented.</ParaText><ParaText id="3720986">This motion also proposes a possible solution by calling on the various levels of government to come together and agree on how to renew long-term social housing funding and reinvest in new housing projects as soon as possible.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3720987">This is a balanced, pragmatic approach that does not require any new money. It would use existing funding. In the medium and long terms, it would save Canadian taxpayers a lot of money in health care, public safety and emergency services for homeless people.</ParaText><ParaText id="3720988">Regardless of what the Conservatives and the Liberals think, housing in Canada should not be considered an expense that can be eliminated in order to balance a budget. Housing is an investment. Unfortunately, that is not how the two old parties see it. Their actions now and in the past prove it.</ParaText><ParaText id="3720989">At least we know what to expect from the Conservatives. When we asked them to support the Canadian housing strategy bill introduced by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170267" Type="2">Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot</Affiliation>, they were faithful to their ideology and all voted against it. That was so predictable.</ParaText><ParaText id="3720990">With the Liberals, we never know which way the wind will blow. Their position depends on the poll of the week, and, as my leader would say, they tend to signal left and turn right.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3720991">When the Liberals came to power in 1993, they cut off federal investment in new social housing projects. In 1996, the Liberal government announced the end of the national affordable housing program.</ParaText><ParaText id="3720992">From then on, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation's only purpose was to manage the federal government's real estate holdings. Eventually, it became just another government cash cow, effectively turning its back on years of investment in social and affordable housing.</ParaText><ParaText id="3720993">In the late 1990s, when the budget was balanced and people were busy comparing themselves favourably to other countries, they somehow forgot to mention that they balanced the budget by creating a major housing shortage, a decision that would have serious long-term repercussions on people, repercussions that we are feeling to this day.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3720994">The irony is that the person who would become the finance minister under Jean Chrétien and would succeed him in 2003, Paul Martin, had previously co-chaired the Liberal Task Force on Housing. The task force produced a report that was published on May 14, 1990, entitled, “Finding Room: Housing Solutions for the Future”. The report accused Mulroney's Conservative government of abandoning its responsibilities for dealing with the housing problems and the crisis at the time. The report included statistics on the housing situation and homelessness in Canada. It denounced the then federal government for its inaction and for abandoning its responsibilities for housing. It argued that the federal government should be a leader on housing in Canada. It listed no less than 25 recommendations.</ParaText><ParaText id="3720995">Honestly, after going through this document, I agreed with most of the recommendations in the report. The problem is that we cannot trust the Liberals. When they are in opposition they will say just about anything to win votes. However, when they are in power, they drop all the plans they presented to the public. That is called electioneering.</ParaText>

							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3721003">How ironic, indeed. When you are in unfamiliar territory, it may be better to say nothing than to preach.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721004">The Conservatives also broke their promises. Everything that was thrown in place was just smoke and mirrors. Today, one out of four Canadian households spends more than 30% of its income on housing, which is the definition for affordable housing. That is more than 3 million families.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721005">Even worse, 37% of households that live in subsidized rental housing, the poorest families in Canada, live in housing that is not affordable. That figure increases to 40% for market rental housing.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721006">What is the response from the other side of the House? It cuts and cuts some more. The long-term agreements signed by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation with suppliers of social housing between 1970 and 1993 have begun to expire. Thus, $1.7 billion of 85% of the CMHC annual budget is slowly being eroded.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721007">The Conservatives say that they are not cutting the budget, but their refusal to renew funding upon the expiry of these agreements translates into reductions. They can play with words, but the people affected, those who could see their rent increase by $200 to $500 a month or more because they have lost their rent subsidy, know exactly what is going to happen and are desperately pleading with the government, which continues to turn a deaf ear.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721008">The figures are clear. They are in previous budgets. A total of $65.2 million was cut in just the past three years: $20.2 million in 2011-12, $21.7 million in 2012-13, and $23.3 million in 2013-14. Furthermore, 18,400 households lost their rent subsidy, and the worst is yet to come.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721009">By 2040, there will be nothing left of the $1.7 billion a year formerly invested in social housing. Nothing. Zero. In Canada, one household in three lives in rental housing. Over the past 15 years, rental housing has accounted for only 10% of new housing stock.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721010">The Conservatives' lack of action on social housing has created this crisis situation. While the demand for social housing is increasing—as demonstrated by long waiting lists—the supply of affordable housing is diminishing. We are still waiting for the government to come up with a plan to deal with this increasingly serious situation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721011">The NDP proposed a plan, a real national housing strategy. Canada is the only G8 country that does not have a such a strategy. The Conservatives collectively rejected this strategy. They are doing nothing and the situation is growing worse.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721012">Given the increasing number of homeless people and the longer and longer wait times for safe, adequate, affordable housing, the federal government needs to stop hiding its head in the sand and ignoring the problem. We have seen that we cannot count on the Liberals or the Conservatives to do anything about housing.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721013">Housing is a priority for the NDP.

I know Mr. Siddall was looking forward to that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721033"> However, we never had the opportunity because, again, the opposition did not ask us any questions. I think that is very telling, I will say, especially given today and the pressure and the scrutiny that the opposition is under with its inappropriate office expenditures. I think, it is a bit telling that it is, all of a sudden, out of the blue, talking about affordable housing.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721034">Again, I am really happy that I can talk about what we are doing, in terms of helping those who are most vulnerable and those who need assistance with housing.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721035">Since 2006, we have invested more than $16.5 billion in housing.

That was $202 million from the province and the federal government.

Note the language that is being used by these ministers of housing in a variety of provinces across the country, “needs and priorities of our province”, “flexibility”, “partnerships between all levels of government, communities and the private sector”.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721054">This not just a coincidence. This is a specific design of the investments that we are making because we respect provincial jurisdiction. Ultimately, it is the provinces that hold the responsibility for delivering housing according to their local needs and priorities.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="55">(1555)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3721055">We provide substantial funds, and we renewed our investment for affordable housing of $1.25 billion. On top of that, in previous budgets, we invested $2 billion for new housing and to renovate existing social housing.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721056">To get back to the investment in affordable housing, we allow the provinces to make decisions on how they want to spend that money. We do not dictate where the money goes.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721057">On this whole idea of a national housing strategy, would that not just be great to have more people sitting around desks in Ottawa telling the provinces, municipalities, and towns how to address their housing needs? I can tell members that in Winkler, Manitoba, we do not want Ottawa telling us how to spend housing dollars. The Liberals and NDP can talk national strategy on everything. We actually get to work. We actually work with the provinces to deliver results.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721058">There are parameters within this program, and the provinces must operate within them. However, it is actually a very broad program because we want the provinces to have the ability they need.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721059">For example, when social housing agreements come to an end, these mortgages are paid off. If the provinces decide that some of these housing programs need additional funding, they can use the funding from the investment in affordable housing program to continue subsidies or provide other subsidies.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721060"> In fact, when I did the signing in British Columbia, I toured a social housing project that was doing very well and had great management. However, when its agreement came to an end, the management said that some of the subsidies would end. At that point, they were not aware of British Columbia's program to provide rent subsidies, and so they were very pleased to hear that we had just signed the renewal for the agreement.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721061">British Columbia has a rent subsidy program. When this particular social housing unit's agreement comes to end, which is very soon, it can go to the province and use some of that funding. I think there were about six units that would need assistance.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721062">This is the way we are working, and it is working very well. Social housing units are becoming more and more aware of the programs that are available.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721063">Alberta is choosing to use the funding we are providing to renovate, retrofit, and build new seniors housing. That is something they believe is a priority. Again, we respect that.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721064">In P.E.I., the intention is to make homes safer and more energy efficient.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721065">My point is that every province is different. We recognize that, so we have provided substantial funding and historic investments, but we are giving the provinces the ability to do what is within their jurisdiction.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721066">Again, it is disappointing that the NDP does not seem to really want to hear that or acknowledge the investment. I do not understand why those members vote against it. It is one thing to ask for more, but why would one vote against something that is presented, whether it is investment in affordable housing or our homelessness partnering strategy that we renewed with a focus on Housing First? The NDP members could stand up and say that is fine and they want even more, but why would they basically throw out something that is so positive just to make a political point? It is disappointing.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721067">While I am on the topic of the homelessness partnering strategy, I am particularly happy with what we have done with the Mental Health Commission of Canada. It did a very extensive study, pilot project, the largest in the world, on Housing First; what it does and what it can accomplish. We renewed our agreements, our homelessness partnering strategy, with a focus on Housing First.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721068">Housing First puts those who are chronically and episodically homeless into a house, first and foremost, so they have a safe, stable home to live in. They can then receive help, whether it is for drug addiction or mental illness. We know that so many people who are homeless struggle with those issues, and Housing First is an evidence-based method for helping those people. The evidence shows that, after two, three, or five years, 73% of them are still housed.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721069">Therefore, it is very disappointing that when we have something that is non-partisan, a method that works and we renewed the funding, again the opposition votes against it.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721070">We are not going to get distracted. We remain focused on housing, while the opposition is kind of all over the board in terms of what the issue of the day is. We do not have issues of the day.

Our government has, indeed, made unprecedented investments in affordable housing for all Canadians. We understand that some households will face financial constraints that will impede their participation in the housing market. This is why we are continuing to work with the provinces, territories, and industry stakeholders to ensure the accessibility of housing for those who are most in need.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721086">I want to join my colleagues in urging the members opposite to acknowledge the important work that has been done by this government to improve access to affordable housing across Canada. Since 2006, our government has invested more than $16.5 billion in housing. I will repeat that. It has invested more than $16.5 billion. These investments have made a difference in the lives of close to 915,000 Canadian individuals and families: everyone from low-income households and seniors to persons with disabilities, recent immigrants, aboriginal people, and victims of domestic violence. In my role as chair of the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills and Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities, I know perfectly well that our approach is working in a balanced and sound way.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721087">I would reflect on some of the comments made through questions and in debate in the House here today that sometimes the solution is simply looked upon, and the idea being put before the House that this is a crisis is somewhat misleading. There are a lot of individuals in this industry, both in the private and social sectors, providing good quality housing for Canadians in need. They need to be looked upon as being champions and advocates for new models that will give the best bang for the buck in terms of what governments do spend.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721088">I would like to take the time to outline a few of the initiatives that form our government's approach. For housing groups that need assistance, our government is providing significant funding under the investment in affordable housing. Funding is provided through provinces and territories that have the flexibility to use federal funding to design and deliver programs that meet local needs and priorities, including rent supplement programs that can be made available to housing providers once their existing operating agreements mature. This is the flexibility that industry advocates have asked for, advocates such as co-ops, social housing, and municipalities.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721089">Our government's initial commitment under the IAH was $716 million over three years, funding that assisted more than 183,000 households. As the member knows, because New Democrats voted against it, economic action plan 2013 renewed the IAH agreements with $1.25 billion in funding over five years. The funding is being implemented through amendments to existing agreements with provinces and territories. Four such agreements have been signed to date, with Alberta, British Columbia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island. As the minister mentioned, we expect agreements with the remaining provinces and territories to be concluded shortly.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721090">Investment in affordable housing is a great example of how our government is working with provinces and territories to fund innovative housing solutions that meet local needs and priorities. We have been told over and over by the groups we have met with that there is no one size that fits all. This has to be determined at the grassroots, on the ground, at the level where we build projects and where projects are needed.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721091">We believe that provinces and territories are in the best position to design and deliver programs that address specific housing needs, meet the priorities in their jurisdictions, and give them the flexibility to do so. It is also important to note that federal funding provided through investment in affordable housing is cost matched by the provinces and territories, so that the total investments by governments will remain significant. I still cannot understand why the NDP would vote against long-term stable funding for affordable housing, especially because we know that investment would go a long way toward improving access to affordable housing in communities across Canada.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3721092">We have also introduced another important change to specifically support social housing providers in 2013. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721093">Social housing providers whose operating agreements allow for the establishment of a subsidy surplus fund can now retain any money they have in this fund to use after their operating agreements mature. Many of these funds have been established because of interest rates going down, so they have had excess funds. They have been good, prudent managers of their social housing stock and they have used and managed that money correctly.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721094">On the flip side, for some groups we have met with, it is the opposite. Some have not, so in some cases the mortgage money that we set out in original agreements has not gone for its intended purposes.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721095">These funds can be used to continue to lower the cost of housing for low-income households living in existing social housing. This represents a common sense approach that will give some social housing projects greater flexibility when operating agreements mature. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721096">This change was warmly welcomed by housing providers, including the 900 members of the Co-operative Housing Federation of Canada. CHF Canada's executive director, Nicholas Gazzard, said at the time:</ParaText><ParaText id="3721097"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">This additional flexibility allows co-ops to use federal funds to provide rent-geared-to-income assistance for vulnerable low-income households, even after their funding agreements have expired.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721098">This is why I am particularly proud of our action plan 2013, through which the government renewed our investment in affordable housing agreements and our homeless partnering strategy with a focus on Housing First. In fact, the NDP voted against $600 million in funding over five years to renew the program. This funding will go a long way to help combat homelessness in our country, and the new focus on Housing First has been lauded from all sectors.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721099"> The Housing First focus builds on the outcomes of the Mental Health Commission of Canada's At Home/Chez Soi research demonstration project, which was funded by the federal government at $110 million over five years and established in five cities: Vancouver, Winnipeg, Toronto, Montreal, and Moncton. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721100">The project, the largest of its kind, ended in March 2013 and demonstrates that the Housing First approach can be effectively implemented in Canadian cities to rapidly reduce homelessness while alleviating pressure on shelters and health and judicial services. The Housing First approach aims to move homeless people from the streets and short-term shelters into immediate and permanent housing while offering support for people with addictions and mental illness. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721101">The project has demonstrated that the Housing First approach can result in significant savings through decreased use of costly resources such as paramedics and police services, particularly for those with high needs.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721102"> Over the course of the study, an average of 73% of participants in the Housing First group remained in stable housing, compared to 32% for the group receiving usual care. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721103">This study also showed that Housing First is a sound financial investment that can lead to significant cost savings. For those participants who were the highest users of emergency and social services, every $10 invested led to an average savings to government of $21.72. Overall, participants in the project were less likely to get in trouble with the law, and those who received both housing and supportive services showed more signs of recovery than those who did not. Housing First is an approach that works really well, and it is innovative.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721104">Our government wants to equip and empower people so that hopefully they can find healing and recovery, and then skills and employment as they become fully participating members of society.

Judy Sgro (York West, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3721118">Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to have the opportunity to speak on an important issue that matters to all of us in the House. I will be splitting my time with my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170090" Type="2">Markham—Unionville</Affiliation>, as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721119">Now that the weather is nice and all of us are getting out, I have to tell members that this past weekend, when I was out in my riding, I had the opportunity to pass through the area around Saint Augustine's church, an important part of the riding. I also passed 35 Shoreham Drive, 711 Arleta Avenue, and 415 Driftwood Avenue, all places that exhibit a tremendous sense of community and neighbourhood pride.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721120">These places are similar for more than just their community spirit. They are buildings owned and managed by Toronto Community Housing, and they are places in which residents are worried. The residents of these buildings are hard-working families who are struggling just to make ends meet. In fact, even with a portion of the rent subsidized, many of these residents are spending as much as 85% of their income on rent alone, leaving just pennies for food, clothing, transportation, medicine, and other essentials.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721121">For many of the tenants living at 2350 Finch Avenue West or 2765 Islington Avenue, the dream of home ownership has crumbled at their feet under the weight of inescapable daily struggles just to survive a vicious and punishing cycle of poverty.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721122">In the past, the concept of personal home ownership was a near guarantee. All that one needed to do was work hard for a decent wage, and the rest was possible. Sadly, for many low-income families in my riding and across Canada, including working families, that promise is now a faint remembrance of a distant dream.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721123">In 1980, the average cost of a detached home was roughly $100,000. The average Canadian made about $41,000 a year, which meant that there was room for a mortgage, transportation, groceries, and the other essentials that come out of a paycheque. Today, the average detached home costs more than double what it did just 30 years ago. In Toronto, the average home price now hovers around $1 million. Despite the spike in costs, the average Canadian still makes about $41,000 a year.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721124">I would also like to point out that many working families in my riding make than far less than $41,000, which only intensifies the problems that they face when it comes to housing. Some are forced, as I said, to pay 85% of their income in rent. Clearly this is not a tenable position, and the fact that the Conservative government is intentionally allowing more and more housing co-operatives' operating agreements to expire is only making issues worse. The government's decision to scale back funding to social housing is reckless and it is, in effect, leaving low-income families out on the street. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721125">Families living in these units know that there is a housing crisis, and they need to understand why. Of course, we know that the housing crisis has hit because the NDP clearly torpedoed both the Liberals' national housing strategy and the current premier's provincial housing program. Worse yet, Tim Hudak is mimicking the inaction of his federal cousins with his pink slip promise. That really unnerves an awful lot of people in my riding.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721126">Put another way, the Conservatives have done nothing to lower or manage housing costs, and they are doing less than nothing to help fix the income situations that our middle-class families face. For example, rather than work to create jobs, Tim Hudak has promised to fire 100,000 Ontario workers. I call it his pink slip promise, and it pulls back the veil on the Conservative ideology when it comes to social programming of all sorts.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721127">The NDP, despite tough-sounding talk, torpedoed both the Liberals' national housing strategy and Kathleen Wynne's housing program in the most recent Ontario budget. Of course, the NDP also voted against a new pension plan for low-income workers as well. It seems that three million working Ontarians who do not have an employer-sponsored pension just had the rug pulled out from under them by an NDP lusting for power.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721128">It is interesting to note that this is the same group that was punished when the NDP smashed the federal daycare and early learning strategy. It seems that there is a trend developing there. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721129">When Andrea, Tim, and their federal counterparts fiddle, middle-class Canadian families feel the burn.</ParaText>

We also talked about the need for innovative programs such as rent to own and government-regulated reverse mortgages that might allow people to both secure and remain in adequate housing.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721134">There was a clear consensus that many working families became trapped in a cycle of high rent payments and were unable to set aside the funds needed for a down payment on a home of their own. This limits their options and prevents them from building equity in their home, from leveraging assets for debt reduction, and from experiencing the pride of ownership.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721135"> All in all, without some kind of a national housing strategy, or better yet a national housing action plan, my constituents living in the San Romanoway community or in the Yorkwoods Village will not have the opportunities they truly deserve and desire.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721136">Knowing all of this, it seems almost inconceivable that the government will sit idle and allow billions of dollars of funding for social housing to simply dry up.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721137"> I am glad to see that the NDP have come back to the table that it once abandoned in favour of the Liberals' stand in support of social housing and opportunities for personal home ownership, but I would like to see the government do more.

							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3721163">It brings to my mind the two individuals who I have met who are the most committed to social, affordable housing. Those people are Claudette Bradshaw and Adam Vaughan. For reasons I will explain, the two are linked.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721164"> Claudette Bradshaw was the driving force for affordable housing in two Liberal governments. She had her SCPI program. She pushed and pushed to make it happen. It did happen. It had results until the NDP brought it down in 2005.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721165">Now we have the new Claudette Bradshaw on the horizon, and I speak of Adam Vaughan, the Liberal candidate for Trinity—Spadina. Adam Vaughan is such an enthusiast for housing that he called me before he was even a candidate and lectured me, or educated me on the importance of housing. Last night I spoke to him, so I am able to impart to the House the wisdom of Adam Vaughan on the subject of housing.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721166">I believe Adam Vaughan will be the new Claudette Bradshaw because I have every confidence that in the not too distant future, he will be pushing a new Liberal government, as an elected member, to do for housing what Claudette Bradshaw pushed an old Liberal government to do. With the force, the character and the argumentative skills of Adam Vaughan, I am convinced the Liberal Party and the Liberal government will carry this through.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721167">I will quote what Adam Vaughan told me last night, “The NDP is more interested in building its party in the House than in building houses for people in need. That's their record”. That is a powerful statement. The NDP would prefer to build people in the House and its party than build houses for people in need. Adam Vaughan does not just say that out of the air; he has two very strong pieces of evidence.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721168"> The first piece of evidence is, as we all know, in 2005 when the Liberal government of Paul Martin produced a budget which had $480 million extra for housing, the NDP brought it down. Instead of getting $480 million for housing and so many billion dollars for affordable child care, we have had almost 10 years of the current <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, thanks to the NDP.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721169">This is Adam Vaughan's second point, and it shows he has his finger on the pulse of Ontario that he would bring this to our attention.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721170"> More recently, the NDP members did it again. They brought down the Wynne government, including that budget. What was part of that budget? Money for housing, $80 million. They brought down the Martin government at a cost of $480 million for housing and they brought down the Wynne government at a cost of $80 million for housing. They bequeathed to Canada almost 10 years of the current <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, and I hope this will not be the case, but the consequence of their action could be that they bequeathed to Ontario some years of Mr. Hudak. I thank the NDP.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721171"> I would go so far as to say that the NDP record on housing is even worse than the Conservative record on housing. The Conservatives do not like affordable housing; they hate it. Just read their 2006 fiscal imbalance document. At least they put a few dollars into housing.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721172">The NDP members have put nothing into housing because they have never been a government. They have produced a silly private member's bill and because it is a private member's bill, it spends no money either. On the positive side of the ledger for the NDP on housing it is zero. On the negative side of the ledger, it is minus $480 million at the federal level and $80 million more at the provincial level. Therefore, on the plus side they have zero and on the minus side they have a minus $560 million contribution to housing.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3721173">The Conservative record is pathetic but I would rather go for a few Conservative dollars than the NDP's minus $560 million for affordable housing.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721174">Let me continue with a bit more on the wisdom of Adam Vaughan because he is truly passionate on this subject. I am convinced that the citizens of Trinity—Spadina would prefer a Liberal candidate who is passionate on housing rather than turn to the NDP, whose record is minus $560 million on housing.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721175">He says that the “NDP is more interested in building its party in the House than in building houses for people in need. That's their record”. I repeat his comment because it is so wise. He also said that smart investments in housing reap major benefits in other areas. It is not just about helping the homeless as the NDP seems to believe, there are other benefits. He then gives three examples. This is straight out of the mouth of Adam Vaughan during my conversation last night.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721176">First, he said that housing constructed near hospitals for nurses is a positive thing because it saves on traffic gridlock, which costs a lot of money and frustration, and it also strengthens the health care system. There are spillover benefits and Adam Vaughan has drawn them to the attention of the NDP and to all members of the House.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721177">The second thing he said is that housing constructed for people with mental health problems and other substance abuse problems will be good for those people, but in addition it will save the government money that it would otherwise have to spend on health care and even social assistance, because if you put a roof over somebody's head you equip that person much better to deal with the future, even if that person has some mental challenges.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721178">The third example he gives is that housing built for students on or near university campuses results in lower student debt, a healthier graduating student population but in addition it leaves a legacy of houses for future generations of students. It's not just a one-time thing. The houses don't get built one year and then disappear the next. They are there for many years to come to support future generations of students, to strengthen the middle class, and to strengthen equality of opportunity in building up our post-secondary education system.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721179">I would recommend to the NDP, and more particularly I would recommend to the citizens of Trinity—Spadina, these wise words from our candidate Adam Vaughan, who not only sees through the negativity of the NDP historically on this record since 2005, but also has strong, sensible, vigorous ideas of his own. We can be sure that once he is a member of the Liberal caucus, housing will be even more on our agenda going forward than it is today.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721180">Adam Vaughan would agree with us and even with the NDP that this business where the government lets these long-term mortgages run out and does nothing to support renters in need or support the co-op industry, is really a recipe for disaster, a recipe for many people becoming homeless. The Conservatives are totally responsible for that. We would urge them to change that misguided policy. It is for that reason that, perhaps principally, we in the Liberal Party will support today's motion by the New Democrats.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

							<ParaText id="3721201">Canada had, up until a couple of decades ago, a very proud story to tell about housing. One way to start into this story is with reference to John Humphrey, something of a Canadian hero. John Humphrey was responsible for the first draft of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. In that declaration, one can find, at article 25, reference to housing. It reads, in part:</ParaText><ParaText id="3721202"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3721203">That reference to housing finds its way three decades later into the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721204">Article 11 recognizes:</ParaText><ParaText id="3721205"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">...the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living for himself and his family, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and to the continuous improvement of living conditions...</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3721206">and so on.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721207">However, if we fast forward to 2009, we have a UN special rapporteur lamenting our more recent history. He says this about Canada:</ParaText><ParaText id="3721208">
								<Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">There has been a significant erosion of housing rights over the past two decades. Canada’s successful social housing programme, which created more than half a million homes starting in 1973, has been discontinued.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721209">Here is the more recent and inglorious history that he is referring to in this quote. The last budget of the Mulroney Conservatives eliminated all federal funding for new social housing and froze spending on existing social housing. It was a move that cut housing investment by $660 million over four years.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721210">The Liberal Party campaigned on a promise to reverse those cuts. Of course, it never did. In fact, only two years later, it slashed a further $128 million from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation's budget, most of which was, at the time, allocated to affordable housing programs.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721211">A year after that, in its 1996 budget, the Liberals walked away entirely from housing, downloading responsibility to provinces and territories. At the same, it is worth noting, they slashed transfers to those very same provinces and territories.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721212">This is how Canada ends up with an ignominious distinction of being the only major industrialized country to not have a national housing strategy.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721213">Just last year, the current Conservative government announced that it would not be renewing the long-term operating agreements that began in the 1970s that the UN rapporteur hailed in his 2009 report. Those agreements provide about $1.7 billion worth of housing subsidies to over 600,000 households in Canada. As that $1.7 billion dries up, mainly, over the next few years, it is anticipated that as many as 200,000 housing units will be lost due to the loss of operating funds or insufficient capital for much-needed renovations.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3721214">Now this may be considered a radical notion to both Liberals and Conservatives in this chamber, but there are simply circumstances in which markets do not work, when they simply do not emerge to meet demand, and so it is in housing.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721215">According to the national household survey, about one-third of households in Toronto spend more than 30% of their income on housing. That is, by the standard definition of affordability, they cannot afford to live in their own homes. Taking into consideration just renters, that number rises dramatically. About 45% of renters in Toronto cannot afford their own homes.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721216"> While this definition of affordability is a very useful standard to use, it is important to note that nothing magic happens at that threshold. As pointed out in a very recent study, in March 2014, by Paradis, Wilson, and Logan at the Cities Centre at the University of Toronto, there is a continuum of inadequate housing, risk of homelessness, and visible homelessness among families living in Toronto's high-rise buildings. Housing is precarious for low-income families in Toronto's high-rises, and it is easy enough to slide up, but mainly down, that continuum. According to the study:</ParaText><ParaText id="3721217"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">...inadequate housing and the risk of homelessness are almost universal among families with children living in high-rise rental apartments.... Almost 90% are facing major housing problems that may place them at risk of homelessness.... One family in three is facing severe or critical risk of homelessness.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721218">Part of the problem is that there has been virtually no growth in new purpose-built rental housing in Toronto since 2006, according to “Toronto's Vital Signs Report 2013”, with just 1,800 units across the entire GTA and only 810 in the city of Toronto itself, this in a city that welcomes 100,000 new residents every year. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721219">This is how we end up in Toronto with about 90,000 households on the waiting list for affordable housing. That unto itself is equivalent to the population of a large Canadian city, about the same size as Saskatoon or Regina. With fewer than 4,000 households from that list being housed every year, that list has grown. With only 650 new units of affordable housing presently under construction in Toronto, we have today what is quite rightly called in the motion a housing crisis.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721220">I frame this issue, with reference to Canadian John Humphrey and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as a matter of human rights. Health, happiness, security, and the opportunity for everyone to realize their potential through education all turn on housing—safe, healthy, affordable housing. This is a truth we have turned away from as a country through successive federal governments over two decades, but it is a truth that exists nonetheless.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721221">I will take the last couple of minutes of my time to talk about the economics of housing. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721222">This motion stands on more than just an ethical footing; it is good economics, too. To understand that, we need look no further than the Conservatives' own budget documentation, and I refer specifically to the data produced by the Department of Finance in support of the government's own economic action plan. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721223">That data points to the very efficient stimulus or multiplier effect of housing investment, showing that for every dollar invested in housing measures, $1.50 of economic activity is created. Interestingly, that compares very favourably to the stimulus measures the current Conservative government prefers. Personal income tax measures have a multiplier of just a dollar over the same timeframe, while business tax measures work very poorly, adding just 30¢ to the economy for every public dollar expended or foregone.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721224">I will finish with a salute to the Federation of Canadian Municipalities and the work it has been doing to bring this housing crisis into the public realm and to the attention of all Canadians. In its press release yesterday, it stated: </ParaText><ParaText id="3721225"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">FCM supports the NDP's continued focus on fixing Canada's Housing Crunch.... The lack of adequate and affordable housing is one of the biggest issues facing Canadians across the country and is a threat to the social and economic growth of Canadian municipalities.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3721226">There is no finer an endorsement, and so I will close there.</ParaText>

							</ParaText><ParaText id="3721244">We face a tremendous housing crunch in this country. I see it on the streets of Toronto every day. I see people whose wages do not allow them to pay the rents in the city of Toronto and people who have other challenges, such as disabilities and mental health challenges. The thing they need most is a roof over their heads. They need housing stability, and that is what is lacking in the city of Toronto and across this country.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721245">A country as large and as cold as Canada ought to have a national policy on this so that we can ensure that everyone is housed and has a warm, safe place to stay. However, in fact, Canada is the only OECD country, the only major developed country, without a national housing strategy. In fact, it has been without a housing strategy since the early 1990s. Why? We used to have one. It was the Liberal government of the time that tabled a constitutional proposal calling for an end to its financial involvement in a number of areas of provincial jurisdiction, including housing.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721246"> It is pretty sad for a country as wealthy as Canada to abandon people that way. The Liberals also ended co-operative housing funding, a program that over its lifetime built nearly 60,000 homes for low- and moderate-income Canadians.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721247">Let us look at the picture today. One in four Canadians spend more than 30% of their income on shelter; 380,000 Canadians live in severe housing need, spending more than 50% of their income on shelter. We are also in a situation where Canadians have record-high personal debt levels, where they owe $1.64 for every dollar of disposable income, and where housing prices are skyrocketing, especially in our urban areas.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721248"> In the city of Toronto, when houses are for sale, we have multiple bids. Many families are driven out of the housing purchase market because they cannot afford these skyrocketing prices, but there are so few affordable housing options. In addition to that, we have about 200,000 social housing units that will be at risk of closing when the long-term federal funding for social housing expires. That will be a calamity for far too many Canadians.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721249">More and more young people are living at home with their parents. It used to be, back in 1981, that about a quarter of young people between the ages of 20 and 29 lived with their parents. Today that number is up to 42% of young people between 20 and 29 living with their parents. I hear that from young people. I also hear that from their parents, who are so concerned about the next generation and what is going to happen to them.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721250"> It is an absolute disgrace that we do not have a national housing strategy and that we are not investing the money we have as a country into building the kind of housing we need.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721251">I want to tell members a bit about my community in Toronto. In Toronto, we have over 167,000 people on the affordable housing wait-list, more than 90,000 households. There are more households on the waiting list for affordable housing than actually live in Toronto's community housing. That is how severe the problem is. We have more people on housing wait-lists than live in some cities across Canada. We have whole cities of people looking for housing.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="05">(1705)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3721252">Let me tell the House about a family I met with who had come here as refugees from a war-torn country. They came here; they finally got accepted. They were living in a bachelor apartment. They were a family of four living in a bachelor apartment in Toronto housing. When I knocked on their door and talked with them, they were so thankful to be here in a safe country like Canada. However, the man I spoke to said that they really needed a better place to live, because they were four people in a bachelor apartment. Their kids were school-aged kids, and they did not have any privacy or a place to study. Surely, we can do better.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721253">I spoke to a family a couple of weeks ago. They were in an apartment, paying $800 a month. They were hoping to move to a two-bedroom apartment. They were in a one-bedroom apartment, but they were a family of five. The two-bedroom apartment was going for $1,100. A month before they were given the new apartment, the ownership of the building changed, and guess what? The rent went from $1,100 to $2,000. It almost doubled. They are going to have to leave because they cannot stay in a one-bedroom apartment and they cannot afford $2,000 a month.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721254">These are the kinds of severe situations that people, certainly in my community of Toronto, are facing. The Liberals cancelled the national housing strategy, but frankly, the Conservatives have made it even worse by not investing in affordable housing and abandoning Canadian families. It is simply unacceptable.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721255">Because no money is being spent on upgrading housing, we are seeing housing that could be available for people but is going vacant. There is a Toronto community house in my riding, on Maria Street, a three-bedroom house that has sat vacant for a year because there was not the money to do the repairs on the house. When we have 70,000 families on the waiting list, and we have places sitting vacant because there is not the money to make these houses inhabitable, that is also a disgrace.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721256">There is so much we ought to be doing. For those who are concerned about costs, the cost of investing in housing, it is more cost effective to give people a roof over their heads and keep them healthy and well than it is to lock people up in jail. That is what happens when people cannot keep body and soul together and have a decent place to live in.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721257">What we are calling for, as New Democrats, is a co-operative approach from the federal government to work with provinces, territories, municipalities, and first nations to address housing needs together, instead of abandoning everyone to their own resources. We are also calling for the federal government to abandon this take it or leave it attitude that it has had for so long. We need a commitment to work with the social housing sector. We need to renew these operating agreements and to provide one-time capital injections for renovations and to reinvest the savings from expired agreements that do not need to be renewed into developing new affordable housing units.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721258">We need to immediately invest in the development of new housing. This could be in the form of new investment from the federal government, low-cost loans from the CMHC, or tax credits for developers of affordable housing, such as those proposed by the Federation of Canadian Municipalities.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721259">Many Canadian organizations support this, including the Chamber of Commerce, as I said, the FCM, the C.D.

However, the current amount of federal funding today, in 2014, is lower than it was in 2007. Therefore, in spite of what we have just heard from the member opposite, clearly the facts speak of something different. Average Canadians are struggling to make ends meet, young families are squeezed, young people do not have a decent place to live, and we have far too many Canadians who face tremendous housing insecurity.

We all want long, happy, and healthy lives for ourselves and for our loved ones. However, mothers and fathers and sons and daughters fall ill, often unexpectedly. The onslaught of a debilitating or even terminal illness will turn lives around, regardless of age, and bring about incredibly tough questions. It is emotional. There is no doubt about that.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721297">There are a great number of us who have had this experience. We all have stories to share.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721298">Mine is my father Mico, a vital and active man, a long-distance runner in his youth, an established businessman and leader, and one of the longest-serving aldermen in Guelph. It shook the foundation of my entire family when he developed Alzheimer's disease. The disease and the toll it took on him fundamentally changed not only his quality of life but also altered how my brothers, sisters, mother, and I related to him.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721299">It is impossible to live through an ordeal like that and not consider any number of options. However, I can say that as terrible as the disease was, the whole experience drew us that much closer to him and our family that much closer together. I learned through experiencing it so intensely that the process of dying and everything associated with it can most often be a process as much for the benefit of the living as it is suffering for those dying.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721300">In that time of need is found a time to serve those dying and a time to possibly attend to unresolved issues. It is a time that would otherwise be lost if we do not care compassionately for our elderly and ailing loved ones.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721301">This might not be the same experience for everyone. We are a diverse country with an incredibly diverse populace. This is why I believe that not only must we work with the provinces to create an integrated and flexible framework but that such a collaborative model is the one way we can fully account for the geographic differences between provinces, between cities, and even between urban and rural divides, as well as our many cultures and communities, from Canada's first nations, Metis, and Inuit, to those most recently arrived, so that good palliative care does not depend on one's area code.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721302">The Canadian Medical Association defines palliative care as:</ParaText><ParaText id="3721303"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">...an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problems associated with a life-threatening illness. It involves the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification, assessment and treatment of pain and other physical, psychosocial and spiritual symptoms.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721304">I believe now, as I believed when I first began working with the member for <Affiliation DbId="170367" Type="2">Kitchener—Waterloo</Affiliation> and the member for <Affiliation DbId="170538" Type="2">Windsor—Tecumseh</Affiliation> as co-chairs of the Parliamentary Committee on Palliative and Compassionate Care, that if people are given a reason to live, feel their lives are relevant and significant, truly do not feel that they are a burden on society or especially on their families, and are enabled to live pain-free, they just might be less inclined to turn to more desperate measures as a relief from the emotional, mental, or physical pain from which they suffer.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721305">I call to mind a beautiful and comprehensive quote from esteemed Canadian Jean Vanier, founder of L'Arche, which accomplishes better than I might the importance of giving people who may be suffering from a serious or terminal illness a reason to carry on. He says:</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721306"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Each of us is fragile, with deep needs for both love and a sense of belonging. We begin and end our lives vulnerable and dependent, requiring others to care for us. ... In our states of dependence, our need cries out for attention and care. If this need is well received, it calls forth the powers of love in others, and creates unity around us, the gifts of the vulnerable to our world. If our cry and our need are unmet, we remain alone and in anguish. ... The danger in our culture of productivity and achievement is that we easily dismiss and ignore as unproductive the gifts and the beauty of our most vulnerable members, and we do so at our own peril, dehumanizing ourselves.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="20">(1820)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3721307">To accomplish this, to elevate those suffering from their solitude and anguish, we must create a framework whereby this can be addressed while also incorporating the possible cultural and regional differences that might be present. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721308">Over the course of our study and in the creation of our non-partisan report, we travelled across Canada, and hundreds of informed Canadians travelled to Ottawa, where we heard from witnesses from coast to coast to coast who shared their stories and experiences with palliative care, elder abuse, and mental health to assist in drafting our report, appropriately entitled “Not to be Forgotten”.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721309">Among our conclusions after hearing from these diverse witnesses was precisely what this motion seeks to accomplish by creating a national palliative and end-of-live care strategy. It would be flexible and integrated for maximum impact on those living through end-of-life events and on the 80% of care provided by families who take up that important yet difficult responsibility. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721310">Through collaboration, the various levels of government and health and well-being stakeholders can develop and implement a nationally recognized framework with standards of care that would improve the quality of life for patients reaching end of life, providing the necessary tools to manage pain and providing more dignity. These tools may come in the form of meaningful tax relief or employment insurance payments for those who leave work to care for their infirm loved ones or in the form of better home care provided by personal support workers, whose jobs are quickly becoming the jobs of the future, or in the form of a national standard for hospice care uniformly applied across Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721311">As the member for <Affiliation DbId="170184" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation> highlighted in his speech on this motion, “...what we are seeing across the country is a real patchwork of services”. This was one of many conclusions reached in our report. He went on to highlight the inconsistency of strategies or even provision of services in cities across Canada. This exemplifies why the strategy must be a national one and why we must start the ball rolling here. We can start here to coordinate with the other levels of government to facilitate collaboration in research and information and to dismantle the series of silos that normally operate in isolation across the country.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721312">For instance, one such strategy is pain management. There has yet to be a comprehensive pain management treatment strategy upon which people can rely. It is currently a hit-or-miss experience with family doctors who are yet to be completely trained in the area of pain management. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721313">We have a responsibility as a national leader and the chief communicator in raising awareness of the issues surrounding end-of-life and palliative care, particularly given the complexities brought forward by the mix of health, emotional, financial, and social pressures. These complexities and failing to deal with them properly, whether by offering help to caregivers or hope for the dying, lead to devastating consequences of their own, consequences I examined quite specifically throughout the committee's report. It became obvious that these pressures in today's society intersect and could lead to family breakdown and even elder abuse.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721314">Beyond this primary leadership role, it is the federal government that sets the standards for universal high-quality care. The provinces are certainly responsible for delivery, but it is delivered best in conjunction with national benchmarks. This is an issue that does or will impact every Canadian at some point, so it is the Government of Canada that needs to step into the role.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721315">My colleague, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170551" Type="2">Vancouver Centre</Affiliation>, pointed out in her remarks on this topic that tens of thousands of seniors die each year in Canada, and not all of them are able to get the kind of care they need as they approach end-of-life issues.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721316">I applaud my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170184" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation> for bringing this motion to the floor of the House and for helping to continue the great work done by parliamentarians from all parties on palliative care. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721317">This motion is not the end of the conversation. I think this is just the beginning. I hope that all of us here in the House can get behind that conversation and then bring it home to our ridings and genuinely create the framework necessary to put a national palliative care strategy together.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="25">(1825)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Angus" id="8363076"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170184" Type="2">Mr. Charlie Angus (Timmins—James Bay, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3721318">Mr. Speaker, as always, it is a great honour to stand in this House, having been given the honour to represent the people of <Affiliation DbId="170184" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation> who put their trust in me.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721319">I want to thank my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170547" Type="2">Guelph</Affiliation> for his support for our motion, my motion, Motion No. 456, but also thank the New Democratic Party for its push to establish a national palliative care strategy.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721320">This is an issue that transcends partisanship because it touches each one of us, and it touches us in our most personal and sacred space, which is the moment between life and death and the moment when a family deals with the loss of a loved one.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721321">I would be remiss if I did not thank for their excellent work all the parliamentarians of all political parties in this House who have worked on the issue of palliative care.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721322">Certainly, the language of the motion comes from the work of the all-party committee, with my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170525" Type="2">Kitchener—Conestoga</Affiliation>, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170547" Type="2">Guelph</Affiliation>, and my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170538" Type="2">Windsor—Tecumseh</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721323">My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170547" Type="2">Guelph</Affiliation> talks about the need for a conversation. I think this is what a motion is. A motion is a statement of principle and a statement of intent by the Parliament of Canada. It can be a very profound moment when parliamentarians are asked to say what it is that we need in order to move forward as a country. Certainly, we recognize, in this federal House, that the delivery of health services in this country is better served at the provincial level. We understand the jurisdictional divisions in the country, and they make sense because, as we move health care closer to the ground level, we can certainly see more proactive and better results.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721324">However, in terms of palliative care, we are faced with a problem because there is a patchwork response right now. All too often, on the issue of palliative care, we see it is considered some form of charity or it is volunteer work, as opposed to an essential, fundamental principle, in terms of where we need that health care in the 21st century. Particularly as we deal with an aging population, as my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170224" Type="2">Vancouver East</Affiliation> has pointed out again and again, the future of health care will be moving more and more out of the hospitals and into the need to have an understanding of ongoing care to ensure that all Canadians have the quality of life they need, particularly when they are faced with a traumatic illness.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721325">Therefore, the mission statement that we are asking for, as all parliamentarians here, is to say that in this House, this federal House, we have a role to play in talking about what palliative care should look like. It is not to dictate how it will be delivered, but we can play an essential role, a powerful role, as a federal government in saying there are models that work.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721326">We see in various parts of the country that the delivery of palliative services is done in an integrated fashion, and where the services are integrated, families are able to receive the care and the support they want and need. However, where the services are not integrated, this money is still being spent. In fact, I would argue, and medical doctors would agree, that we are spending more money, yet people are still falling through the cracks.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721327">The palliative solution is the common-sense solution staring politicians in the face. They just need to say at this time that we need a political will to talk about end-of-life care.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721328">I would like to say that when we mention “palliative” to Canadians, they suddenly think, “Oh, God. Why are you talking about death?” It will do us good, I think, to look at some of the fundamental definitions, for example, used by the Canadian Medical Association.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721329">When it talks about palliative care, the word “death” is not there. It is about life. It is:</ParaText><ParaText id="3721330"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">...an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problem associated with life-threatening illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification, assessment and treatment of pain and other symptoms, physical, psychosocial and spiritual.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721331">I would also point out the definition of “dying with dignity”, which has been a term that we see often in the media. The Canadian Medical Association says:</ParaText><ParaText id="3721332">
								<Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">“Dying with dignity” indicates a death that occurs within the broad parameters set forth by the patient with respect to how they wish to be cared for.... It is NOT synonymous with euthanasia or physician assisted death.</QuotePara></Quote>
							</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="30">(1830)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3721333">This is a very powerful statement that the Canadian Medical Association has brought forward for us.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721334">I would like to speak a little bit about the amendment that was brought forward by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170224" Type="2">Vancouver East</Affiliation>, who has been so committed to the issue of ongoing care and has done much more work on the issue of palliative care than I have over the years. In her amending language to this, she would clarify:</ParaText><ParaText id="3721335"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That, in the opinion of the House, the government should establish a Pan-Canadian Palliative and End-of-life Care Strategy by working with provinces and territories on a flexible, integrated model of palliative care that: (a) takes into account the geographic, regional, and cultural diversity of urban and rural Canada as well as Canada’s First Nation, Inuit and Métis people; (b) respects the cultural, spiritual and familial needs of all Canadians; and (c) has the goal of (i) ensuring all Canadians have access to high quality home-based and hospice palliative end-of-life care, (ii) providing more support for caregivers, (iii) improving the quality and consistency of home and hospice palliative end-of-life care in Canada, (iv) encouraging Canadians to discuss and plan for end-of-life care.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721336">Tonight, I would just like to focus for a second on the importance that we recognize in the House the cultural, spiritual, and familial needs of families. This is not just about the individual. The death of a loved one and the passage through to that other place is one of the defining moments in the life of a family. When there is palliative care and support, it can be a very transformative moment. When the support is not there, it can be a moment of crisis that families sometimes never recover from.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721337">I would like to say that this motion, as I said at the beginning, is not about the partisanship in the House. This has been a very bitter and toxic Parliament, but we all need to say that we are going to put some of our own political agenda aside.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721338">I know that some of my colleagues in the Conservative Party are made nervous by the word “strategy”. The strategy is the language that came from the all-party committee, and I certainly believe that the notion of strategy is important. Some of our Conservative colleagues would prefer to use the word “framework”. It does not matter to me if it is a strategy and/or framework. What matters is that we stand in this House and say that we will support this.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721339">I would like to try to find a way that, tonight, we can make an agreement. I would like for us to find the language that makes everyone comfortable so that we will all stand in the House. No matter what happens with this motion, we have to show Canadians that we understand this.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721340">The simplest way to do this is to ask for unanimous consent for the following motion: that, notwithstanding any Standing Order or usual practice of the House, the amendment to Motion No. 456 standing in the name of Ms. Davies of Vancouver East be deemed adopted, and that the main motion as amended be further amended by adding after the word “Strategy” the words “and/or Framework”.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

This motion we have before us calls on the federal government to develop a nationwide palliative and end-of-life care framework or strategy, “framework” being what we Conservatives prefer. Either way, we do need to get this under way in our country, based on some very good recommendations from a committee of this House.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721347">As mentioned before, in 2010 several members of Parliament formed that all-party Parliamentary Committee on Palliative and Compassionate Care, and in 2011 they published their report, “Not to be Forgotten: Care of Vulnerable Canadians”. Several of their excellent recommendations are embodied in this motion before us. As was mentioned, the Conservative member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="170525" Type="2">Kitchener—Conestoga</Affiliation> co-chaired that committee, and Motion No. 456 benefits from the excellent work done by a number of other members from all parties in the House.

							<ParaText id="3721356">I had the privilege, in a younger era of my life, of working in seniors care homes as a health care worker, as an orderly in a hospital and also in a seniors care setting. In those early days when I thought the whole of my life stretched before me, I was a young guy with all these possibilities and was also interacting with, serving, working with, and ministering to those who were in their sunset years of life. As I had those interactions and got good advice from people and enjoyed the conversations and the wisdom of their years, I also began to more and more realize that I was vulnerable, that I was not invincible, and that I would not live forever. My parents, thankfully, and others had informed me of that same thing already, but it kind of affected me a little more as I looked into the wrinkled faces and frail eyes of the individuals who were in those home care situations.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721357">There is all the more need today, as we have the aging baby boomers moving to retirement years. More pressure is being placed on society and on governments to discuss the needs and the concerns, including end-of-life care. The issue of euthanasia keeps coming up, and assisted suicide. Elder abuse and quality of life are things we should be talking about, and we should be standing in the way of abuse of our dear senior people as they live out their final golden years.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721358">An aging population means that doctors and nurses will be increasingly facing the population and the public with end-of-life issues. I believe that at the core and heart of it is support for human dignity, as  we are all individuals made, in my view, in the image of God, from a Judeo-Christian point of view and that of some of the other world religions as well, so there needs to be that respect and support for human dignity and quality of life, with investments in pain management and other palliative care tools. That is where the Canadian conversation definitely needs to go.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="35">(1835)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3721359">We do not want to go down the dangerous and failed route of assisted suicide or euthanasia tried by other countries. We need better, consistent, end-of-life and palliative care in Canada. Palliative care and emotional support are necessary and appropriate responses to those who suffer from terminal illnesses and are near death.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721360">Effective palliative care will also reduce the pressure to legalize assisted suicide and euthanasia. The Canadian Association of Palliative Care distinguishes four main reasons that patients request death: pain and physical suffering; loss of control over their illness, their lives, their bodies; the desire not to be a burden; and depression and psychological distress linked to their illness.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721361">Palliative care is the most prominent alternative to the legalization of assisted suicide and euthanasia. As opposed to therapeutic obstinacy, aggressive treatment that might prolong a patient's life to the detriment of his or her quality of living, palliative care instead aims to provide “better medical care for pain and symptom control and to attend more appropriately to the personal, emotional and spiritual issues at the end of life”. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721362">Advance care directives are also important to talk about in this conversation. I am sure members in the House are familiar with that, so that should take place well before the time comes for any of us. I do not have an advance care directive, but I am certainly reminded in the midst of these days and this topic that every one of us should be having those discussions with a spouse, our children, and with loved ones, about the kinds of measures that can be taken and the kinds that are beyond what we would want or require, the heroics, so to speak, that sometimes do not end in proper end-of-life care.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721363">As an end-of-life treatment, it addresses the psychological and existential factors that influence requests for assisted suicide and euthanasia. We need to have instead these other topics of discussion: advance care treatment, advance care directives and also the kind of palliative care and pain relief that we would desire. Palliative care targets the sources of a patient's anxiety, therefore renewing his or her will to live, the overall quality of his or her life and ultimately, the quality of his or her death.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721364">I would like to share a couple of brief anecdotes that look at life on the ground in Canada as Canadians serve those who need special care at the end of their lives.

We know exactly what it's like to be caregivers to the dying too, how emotionally, spiritually and physically exhausting it can be in that role”. They look forward to the day when local families who can't tend to dying loved ones at home can select hospice care, rather than hospitals or long-term care facilities.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3721366">The author of the article about palliative care also shared her own story, concluding this way. She said:</ParaText><ParaText id="3721367"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">I'll forever be grateful for the privilege of helping to care for my father during his last days.

							<ParaText id="3721368">The world of palliative care continues to grow as the need expands and technology advances, but much more is needed. In recent years, each time the budget period rolls around, I have been urging the finance minister to commit more funds to palliative care. The passage of this motion would be a clear indication of Parliament's support for such a move.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721369">Much more could be said in the way of dignity therapy, and members can google this. I would have mentioned in my speech, had I had more time, the work of Dr. Harvey Max Chochinov of the University of Manitoba, a very novel therapeutic intervention for suffering and distress at the end of life. Much can be said about pain relief at the end of life and there is a lot that can be done that is not much understood by the Canadian public, a crucial part of palliative care and what we need to be doing to provide the end-of-life relief for people as they fade from this life to the next.</ParaText>

We all surely agree that this notion is very much at the heart of the Canadian ethic, an ethic of caring that guides us collectively whenever we, as a nation, develop public policy or adapt it to new and evolving realities.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721371">I would like to take this idea a step further to say that the measure of a society, of its moral maturity and of the point it occupies on the scale of civilization is found in whether and how it provides physical and spiritual comfort to those in their final days of life. This is why I agreed to be a founding member of the All-Party Parliamentary Committee on Palliative and Compassionate Care that in 2011 issued its report entitled “Not to be Forgotten: Care of Vulnerable Canadians”. This report is the basis of the motion we are debating today, calling for a national palliative care strategy in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721372">It is important to understand what palliative care is not. Palliative care is not euthanasia. Some describe euthanasia as “the final stage of good palliative care”, confusing palliative sedation, an infrequent use of powerful sedatives to induce artificial sleep or coma, with terminal sedation, in which a patient is sedated with the primary intention of precipitating death.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721373">The committee's report makes a point of saying that we must deal with end-of-life issues with uncompromising clarity. Democratic choice requires clear and informed debate to be said to be truly democratic. To quote again from the report:</ParaText><ParaText id="3721374"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">We recommend building a national consensus on clear, unchanging terminology pertaining to end-of life-care. Confusion as to the meaning of terms and even deliberate obfuscation of end-of-life terminology for political reasons causes much unnecessary tension in end-of-life discussions.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3721375">Nor is palliative care simply pain control. Incidentally, the committee, in its hearings, heard that chronic pain affects a surprisingly large number of Canadians. Dr. Ray Hasel, an anesthesiologist at the Lakeshore General Hospital in Montreal's West Island, who appeared as a witness before the committee, is a strong advocate for expanding public health care services to include routine treatment of chronic pain.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721376">Governments, however, are reticent to foray wholesale into this area. This is because the problem is so pervasive that governments fear a major drain on the public treasury should they do so. To quote from the committee's report:</ParaText><ParaText id="3721377"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Chronic pain costs more than Cancer, heart disease and HIV combined.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3721378">This fear of opening the financial floodgates is no doubt one reason why governments exclude fees for physiotherapy and osteopathic treatment from the definition of tax-deductible medical expenses under federal and provincial income tax acts.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721379">In terms of end-of-life care, there are anecdotal reports of pain relief being withheld from dying patients for fear by medical practitioners that giving powerful pain drugs could hasten death, something for which the practitioner could then be held liable. These reports are consistent with the fact that, as a rule, only 30% of ordered medication is actually given.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721380">A relief from pain is a human right. The Declaration of Montreal, adopted on September 3, 2010 at the 13th World Congress on Pain, affirms, among other things, “the right of all people with pain to have access to appropriate assessment and treatment of the pain by adequately trained professionals”.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721381">The declaration also affirms the obligation of health care professionals in a treatment relationship with the patient within the scope of the legal limits of their professional practice and taking into account the treatment resources reasonably available “to offer to a patient in pain the management that would be offered by a reasonably careful and competent health care professional” in that field.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721382">What may be needed therefore is legislation to implement this human right to appropriate pain management, as well as to clarify the limits of liability medical practitioners would face when administering drugs for the purpose of relieving a patient's pain, but without intent to hasten death.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721383">Exploring such a legislative framework could be among the goals of a national palliative care strategy, as would be developing an ethics guide and medical protocols for administering pain relief at end of life, but again, palliative care is more than pain control.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="45">(1845)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3721384">Teresa Dellar, founder and executive director of the West Island Palliative Care Residence, and Rose De Angelis, nursing director at the residence, define palliative care as follows: </ParaText><ParaText id="3721385"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Palliative care affirms life, while helping to ease the physical, emotional and social distress of the patient and his or her family....</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3721386"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">[Terminally-ill patients look to] focus on creating life-affirming moments that bring great satisfaction, closure and even joy. ...palliative care professionals and volunteers, walk beside them and support them through...the process of dying.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3721387">Like pain relief, palliative care is increasingly becoming considered a basic human right. Dan Cere of McGill University, who testified before the committee, stated:</ParaText><ParaText id="3721388"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Palliative care is part of a movement toward fundamental justice and basic human rights for citizens facing the last fragile stage of life....</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3721389"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">It challenges narrow, impoverished and dehumanizing ways of dealing with dying. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3721390">In the same vein, in 2003, the European Committee of Ministers, in Declaration 24, affirmed that “palliative care is... an inalienable element of a citizen’s right to health care”. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721391">This notion of a right to palliative care was also captured in the 2000 Canadian Senate report entitled “Quality End-of-life Care: The Right of Every Canadian”. We are not doing enough in Canada to implement this right through making quality palliative care accessible to all Canadians. This is because, to quote the committee's report:</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721392"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Public policy...tends to be insensible to human fragility.... Public policy decisions reflect a compromise amongst a cross section of groups, none of whom are particularly vulnerable, and none of whose economic and political interests naturally coincide with those who are. The most vulnerable in society are not part of the day to day experience of policy planners.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3721393">Consequently, palliative care remains relatively unknown and little understood. Despite the good progress that is being made by those working hard to raise its profile as an emerging health care issue, palliative care has yet to reach a threshold in public awareness that would prompt governments to accord it the attention and funding it merits. The result is that only 30% of Canadians who will die this year will have access to palliative care. Moreover, palliative care is unevenly available across the country, with access, in essence, a function of a person's postal code. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721394">Finally, only 16% of Canadians will have access to end-of-life care in a hospice. In this regard, we are fortunate in Montreal's West Island to harbour the West Island Palliative Care Residence, the largest in Canada in terms of available palliative care beds. Supporting Teresa Dellar and Rose De Angelis in their compassionate mission to provide the community with the highest possible standards of palliative care and, at the same time, serve as a model to the country of what palliative care could and should be is a profoundly dedicated staff and corps of volunteers, not to mention an army of loyal and generous individual and corporate sponsors.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721395">In addition to a national palliative care strategy, we need a national palliative care secretariat in Canada to put the kind of independent focus on this specialized type of health care that will not truly be possible if responsibility for palliative care policy remains within Health Canada's departmental structure. As a bonus, an independent palliative care secretariat could also be the locus for creating and implementing a national pain strategy to help Canadians living with chronic pain outside of palliative end-of-life circumstances.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Control of pain, of other symptoms and of psychological, social and spiritual problems is paramount. The goal of palliative care is the achievement of the best possible quality of life for patients and their families.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721403">In both of these definitions, palliative care is focused on the person's quality of life. Palliative care reduces families' emotional and financial stress. It focuses on the patient and the patient's family and reduces the cost of care by 50% or more, while mitigating the emotional stress of those who are trying to deal with the loss of a loved one.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721404">I would like to take the time to talk about the difficulty of obtaining palliative care in many areas of Canada, Papineau being one of them. Papineau is a large, rural regional county municipality. It does not have much in the way of palliative care, since the only facilities offering this type of care are in Gatineau. That is far away, which makes it very difficult for families to be close to their dying loved ones. In the Outaouais region, the number of available spaces and beds does not meet the demand.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721405">The community has rallied around a project to build a palliative care hospice, called Le Monarque, in Plaisance. The community is eagerly awaiting the construction of a palliative care hospice for the area covered by the Centre de santé et de services sociaux de Papineau, which includes Buckingham, Vallée de la Lièvre and Vallée de la Petite-Nation in the Outaouais. There are many working groups made up of numerous volunteers and stakeholders from throughout the Outaouais and the community who are working towards that goal.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721406">So far, through the volunteers' hard work, a piece of land that is suitable for a palliative care hospice has been purchased, a business plan has been created and various funding, promotion and construction options for the hospice have been developed. The land is in Plaisance.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721407">I would like to point out how great a challenge this project is. The goal is to offer palliative care, free of charge, to every resident of the area covered by the CSSS de Papineau. The demand is so great that the organization has even found a temporary solution for providing care until the hospice is built. Six beds are going to be set up in an old convent.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721408">Manon Cardinal, the chair of Le Monarque's board of directors, is working tirelessly on this project. She is going to great lengths to make it happen. I commend her and the entire board of directors on their work. They are committed to this project and are working hard to make it reality. They entire community has come together.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721409">We are participating in a number of fundraising events to help fund the project. One of those events had former Canadiens player Guy Lafleur as honorary chairman. He is a proud native of the area.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721410">For six years, people have been collecting money through fundraising events. However, Le Monarque is struggling to come up with the money to construct the building in Plaisance, a project estimated to cost $1.8 million.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721411">Ms. Cardinal is now trying to find less expensive contractors, which could help lower the cost of construction.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="55">(1855)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3721412">For example, they found someone who will dig a foundation for free and an electrician who will provide them with free labour. It is not just social and political community players who are involved in this project. This project is truly important to and driven by the community of the RCM of Papineau. This community spirit is very representative of the wonderful Petite-Nation region, where people really like to help each other out.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721413">These dedicated volunteers have to go the extra mile because of this government's utter lack of a planning strategy. They have to perform miracles with very little in the way of resources. I commend them for their work. The federal government should show some leadership on this because the situation could be much better.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721414">Despite the extraordinary work being done by various groups in Canada, we have an unacceptable patchwork of services, and the end-of-life care that is provided is not subject to any standards really. Only a small number of provinces consider this type of care an essential service.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721415">That means that only 16% to 30% of Canadians have access to palliative and end-of-life care services, depending on where they live in Canada. However, there is consensus in Canadian civil society: 96% of Canadians support palliative care.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721416">The time has come for the federal government to show leadership on this. Unfortunately, in 2007, the government cut funding from the Secretariat on Palliative and End-of-Life Care. However, in June 2011, the all-party Parliamentary Committee on Palliative and Compassionate Care recommended that the federal government restore the Secretariat on Palliative and End-of-Life Care in order to develop and implement a national palliative care and end-of-life care strategy. This committee did excellent work and truly enjoyed the co-operation of the House. You know that, Mr. Speaker. You were part of it.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721417">I was a member of the Standing Committee on the Status of Women when it studied the issue of elder abuse. We consulted this report and understood how important end-of-life care is. I greatly appreciate the work that was done by this all-party committee. It proves that we must show some real co-operative leadership. That is what Canadians deserve and want.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721418">The NDP believes that quality palliative and end-of-life care should go hand in hand with huge changes in our public health care system, including the expansion of quality home-based long-term care services, affordable medications and better access to primary care. We also believe that we have to take into account the geographic, regional and cultural diversity of urban and rural Canada and respect the cultural, spiritual and familial needs of first nation, Inuit and Metis people.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721419">We must also aim at ensuring that all Canadians have access to high-quality home-based and hospice palliative end-of-life care, providing more support for caregivers and improving the quality and consistency of home and hospice palliative end-of-life care. Finally, Canadians must be encouraged to discuss and plan for end-of-life care.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721420">I will close with the hope that this issue that is so important to my riding, and to all regions of Quebec and Canada, will be overwhelmingly supported by all members of all parties in the House. A pan-Canadian palliative and end-of-life care strategy is necessary. We must implement it, of course, together with the provinces, the territories and first nations for the benefit of all Canadians.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I joined as a co-chair with the member for <Affiliation DbId="170547" Type="2">Guelph</Affiliation> and also the member for <Affiliation DbId="170538" Type="2">Windsor—Tecumseh</Affiliation>, whom I believe you know very well. It was a real honour for me to join with that group and many other colleagues from all parties to produce the report on palliative and compassionate care.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721424"> I want to read a bit of the introduction of that report to give Canadians an idea as to how this came about and the actual work that was done. It states:</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721425"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The Parliamentary Committee on Palliative and Compassionate Care (PCPCC) is an ad hoc, all party group of MPs, dedicated to improving care for elderly, dying and vulnerable Canadians. It is unique in the history of the Canadian Parliament as it was formed by the MPs on their personal initiative and funded out of their member office budgets.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3721426"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The committee is an example of what is possible when MPs work closely across party lines on issues of profound concern to everyone. The spirit of non partisan collaboration exhibited by the members of the committee is a great example of what parliament is at its best.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3721427"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Receiving testimony from hundreds of people at twenty four hearings, and local round tables, MPs were profoundly impressed by the dedication and depth of concern expressed by Canadians for issues surrounding the way palliative and compassionate care is practised in our country.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3721428">Also, over the course of this study, I had the opportunity to visit different palliative care places and hospices across the country. One that sticks out in my mind was when I visited a hospice in the riding of Sarnia—Lambton. My colleague there hosted us for one of the round tables and then we visited the hospice. I was deeply moved by the compassion and empathy that the medical personnel, especially the doctors, showed for their patients, as well as the nurses and other support personnel as well. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721429">These kinds of examples are multiplied across the country. Our task is to see that these are replicated in many more communities, especially in our rural communities, across Canada. This is at the heart of what the motion, and the recommendation of the committee, is all about. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721430">Our government recognizes the growing need of Canadians for compassionate end-of-life care. There is no doubt that care should be there when people really need it, but it should also be the best care possible and made available at a reasonable cost to Canadians. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721431">Despite the fact that most people say they would prefer to die in the comfort of their own home, the truth of the matter is that about 60% of Canadians spend their last days in a hospital setting. This is clearly not the preferred place to be, for a variety of reasons. Care at the end of life in hospitals can take a toll on patients, their families and other caregivers and is particularly taxing on the health care system. Additionally, it has implications on hospital wait times for emergency services and may limit the availability of hospital beds. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721432">One of the solutions to address this issue and its unintended consequences is palliative care services. Palliative care focuses on relieving suffering and improving the quality of living and dying. It benefits people of all ages dealing with life threatening conditions, such as AIDS, cancer and cardiovascular disease. Palliative care treats the physical, psychological, social, spiritual and practical needs of the person who is dying. It also recognizes the needs of that person's family and other loved ones. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721433">While many people associate palliative care with hospices and hospitals, it can be delivered in a variety of settings, including long-term care facilities, or even in one's own home. Again, I would just like to refer to a quote from the report, which states: </ParaText><ParaText id="3721434"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> The palliative care philosophy is person-centred, family-focused and community-based.

Sickness almost always goes beyond the purely physical and purely mechanical. The mind, the heart, the will, and the human need to be put back at the centre of the doctor's vocation. I think that captures very well what palliative care is.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721439">Palliative care has been in Canada for several decades, yet it is estimated that about 70% of Canadians do not have access to it. Access is particularly limited in rural and remote areas.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721440">Historically, palliative care in Canada has focused on care delivered in hospitals by specialists. Thus far, the main recipients of palliative care have been cancer patients who are battling for their lives against this potentially fatal disease.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721441">Today there is increasing demand to make palliative care services available to all people with life-threatening conditions and to have options as to where Canadians will spend the last days of their lives. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721442">A recent survey commissioned by the Canadian Hospice Palliative Care Association showed that the topic of end-of-life care is an important one for Canadians. This survey also highlighted that Canadians have a general understanding of palliative care and overwhelmingly support it. However, the survey also revealed that people need more information about how to access the care available where they live.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721443">Like other healthcare services, delivery of palliative care is mainly the responsibility of provinces and territories. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721444">As members have heard from my colleague, the parliamentary secretary, some time ago, this government is already supporting initiatives aimed at enhancing greater capacity in our healthcare system to provide palliative care. While there is still work to do to improve end-of-life care, I am happy to be able to illustrate to members that progress has been made. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721445">All provinces now offer palliative care services to some extent, and there are some promising practices that I would like to highlight. For example, Fraser Health in British Columbia and Niagara West in Ontario have adopted models that seek to integrate palliative care across all care settings and for all types of diseases. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721446">In my own home region of Waterloo, I am aware of a number of services that are available. HopeSpring Cancer Support Centre is providing support for those who are newly diagnosed with cancer. Lisaard House is a hospice. I have heard many positive stories and have had personal contact in terms of patients who have been served by Lisaard House in the Waterloo Region, and I am very grateful for that. Also, Hospice Waterloo Region, Qualicare, Sunnyside Home, and the Grand River Regional Cancer Centre provide hospice care. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721447">These health authorities are also building capacity by partnering family doctors with palliative care specialists. Knowing that they can draw on this expertise gives family doctors the support they need to continue to provide high-quality, personalized care to their patients.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721448">As a routine part of care, physicians are also encouraged to have discussions with patients about their end-of-life care preferences before an illness occurs so that they can better understand their patients' wishes.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721449">Resources that were once spent in hospitals are now being used to support the delivery of services in the community. This has resulted in an overall improvement in the quality-of-life care provided to patients as well as an increase in the number of people accessing end-of-life care services.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721450">In Winnipeg, the palliative care program offers round-the-clock coverage for people who wish to spend their last living days at home. To enable this process, a palliative care doctor issues a medicine kit for use in the patient's home equipped with all the medications an individual might require to control symptoms for a period of 24 hours. If necessary, a palliative care nurse can perform a home visit and use this kit on the patient. If a symptom crisis occurs, it can be handled right in the patient's home rather than having them rushed to the emergency department that may be either just around the corner or far away from the patient's home.</ParaText>

I again reference the excellent work the committee did before me.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721460"> It has been amazing on this journey that it is not an issue that seems to exist within the Ottawa media bubble. It is not something that is perceived as perhaps hot enough or interesting enough. However, when we have gone out into communities and talked with the faith groups and the people who are dealing with it in their communities in rural and urban Canada, we have seen the same conversations in downtown Toronto as we have seen in rural areas. They are about the importance of supporting families and having the measures in place that help families, not just individuals, deal with pain and the heavy psychological and medical issues in facing life-threatening illnesses. They are about the need to support families in those moments so that they can have that period when their loved one can be taken through and the family can be taken through in a manner that allows them come out whole on the other side.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721461">This is bigger than any of us individually. It is bigger than any of our individual parties. It is a moment when we have to try to work together. I would like to think that we will stand in the House and do that.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721462">I would like to thank my colleagues who have done the work. We have gone back and forth on language and what the language means. Certainly, as someone who considers himself a wordsmith, I understand the importance of language. I also understand that there is a moment when the motion has to be put, when people have to stand and say that in the Parliament of Canada in 2014, we recognize this important, fundamental fact. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721463">Simply making a palliative care strategy and/or framework motion will not be the solution. The solution will come from all the civil society groups that will look to Parliament and say that we made that commitment to the Canadian people, and now it is time to follow through. They are the same groups that will go to the provinces and regional health bodies and say that the Parliament of Canada spoke on the vision of comprehensive, supportive, palliative care that respects the familial, spiritual, and cultural needs of Canadians. It will be those people who then will put the pressure back on us so that we deliver on this promise.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721464">Today is the first part of that commitment to Canadians to say that we get it. We understand that we need to start pushing out and speaking about the importance of the common sense solution. It maybe is not seen as a hot button issue or a sexy issue, but it is an issue that touches all of us. Civil society, faith communities, and rural and urban people will then come back to us and say, “this is what it looks like”.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721465">Within our role in the federal government, we do not deliver the health services on the ground, nor should we, but we have a role to play to say that these models and options work. By working together with the provinces and territories and respecting their jurisdictions, we can actually establish frameworks that will help ensure that all Canadians are able to really and truly, when they need it, die with dignity, and families will be able to move forward in healing.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721466">I am asking my hon. colleagues for their support on Motion No. 456.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

There are two issues at play in my riding and for the northern coastline, even in southern Labrador through to the Northern Peninsula and the rest of Newfoundland. Basically, we are looking at fishing areas 2J, 3K, and 3L. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721481">The first issue is with respect to the shrimp fishery. It suffered a big cut in the inshore fishery of 30%, whereas the offshore fleet was left out of it by only 2%. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721482">The other major issue is ice compensation, which I asked about in the House last week. I spoke to a fish harvester in my riding, Ron Coles, who lives not too far from me. Ron updated me on just how bad it is with the ice forming now in all the major harbours. I am talking about White Bay, Green Bay, Notre Dame Bay, and even around the cape toward Bonavista Bay. The ice is hampering the crab fishery, no doubt, as well as the other fisheries involved. A lot of people cannot get out. As a result, it is a devastating situation. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721483">Many people who rely on fishing EI benefits have not received a cheque since the middle of April, and now it is a month since that time. They have had no income for about a month. This is affecting the harvesters, the crews on their boats, and hundreds of plant workers.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721484">My question, once again, is for the parliamentary secretary. When can we get an answer on what should be an ice compensation package to get some income for these people who have been devastated by the ice?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Answer" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Kamp" id="8363111"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="194849" Type="18">Mr. Randy Kamp (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3721485">Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for the question again. We have had this dialogue more than once, but I appreciate his persistence on this matter and I know he represents his constituents well. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721486">I can assure the member and the Speaker that the <Affiliation DbId="194616" Type="4">Minister of Fisheries and Oceans</Affiliation> shares the member's concern that ice conditions have delayed the opening of some fisheries, thereby affecting their ability to earn a living.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721487">Let me stress, however, that ice packs are a common phenomenon of the environmental conditions in Newfoundland and Labrador. I know my colleague knows this. It is not unheard of for the start of the fishing season to be delayed by heavy ice, but conditions can change and do change significantly, depending on a number of factors, including wind conditions and currents. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721488">In fact, such was the case in 1997, 2000, 2003, and 2008. In those years, requests for compensation were made, but in those instances it was determined that the situation did not warrant special compensation, given that ice conditions seemed to be lasting for perhaps only four or five weeks.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721489">It is true that in some years that extreme conditions have prompted income compensation for fish harvesters. Fisheries and Oceans Canada provided compensation in 1984, 1985, 1991, and 2007. The last compensation program, delivered in 2007, was in response to exceptional conditions, the ice packs having delayed some fisheries in Newfoundland and Labrador and northeastern Quebec until the late spring and early summer.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721490">Under the current employment insurance program, EI benefits for fishers are dealt with separately under the Employment Insurance Act. In fact, fishers are able to make claims and receive benefits twice each year for up to 26 weeks each time. This reflects the unique nature of the fishing industry, which has a summer and a winter finishing season. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721491">As pointed out by the hon. member, major delays in fishery openings that are normally scheduled for early May or mid-May could have economic repercussions, and that is why Fisheries and Oceans is monitoring the situation very closely.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721492">I have been told that current ice conditions on the northeast coast of Newfoundland indicate less ice now than at the same point in 2007. Latest forecasts of warm weather should also help break up the ice and facilitate the beginning of the fishery.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721493">In closing, I will say again that DFO is continuing to monitor the ice conditions carefully. However, given that only a few fisheries have been affected by ice conditions so far and given marked improvements in ice conditions to date, ice conditions do not appear to be of sufficient scope or severity to warrant temporary assistance at this time.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I can only assume that would be case here again, but I am not sure if I am reading this correctly. Is the door closed on this? </ParaText><ParaText id="3721495">When I spoke to Ron Coles from Embree this morning, he mentioned this devastating situation, and it is not really warm weather that is needed. If we ask the fishermen, they will say they need a couple of storms, those strong winds to get the ice out into the ocean and away from the harbours. That is the key here.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721496">I thank the parliamentary secretary for coming in to do this, but my question is, very pointedly, if this situation we have right now persists, is the possibility still open to provide ice compensation, as was provided in 2007 and 2009? Let us bear in mind that I now have close to 200 calls in my offices alone over ice compensation and how nobody can get out there on the water.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It is too soon to know whether this is one of those years. Ice conditions can and do change dramatically over a short period of time. Given the unpredictability of ice conditions, we are monitoring this situation very closely.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

More than this, we are building the most prosperous middle class in the industrialized world.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721584">A recent <I>New York Times</I> study found that after-tax middle-class incomes in Canada, which were substantially behind in the year 2000, now appear to be higher than in the United States.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721585">Today, Canada is stronger and more prosperous than ever before.

Jim Flaherty</Affiliation>, a great Canadian, whom we all miss.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3721586">The global outlook remains uncertain. Our economy has been hampered by weak export markets and lower commodity prices. Global growth is still at risk. Many of our allies are deeply in debt. Industrialized countries continue to post deficits. While new economic giants are emerging, the list of our competitors is growing. That is why we cannot become complacent. We will have to continue on the path set out by the Conservative government if we want to ensure that Canada is prosperous.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3721587">This path, our economic action plan, depends on five key pillars.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721588"> Prosperity begins with our first pillar: low taxes. Low taxes create a climate for businesses to grow. Businesses create jobs and growing businesses create more jobs. That is why our government cut more than $60 billion in taxes for job-creating businesses between 2008 and 2014. KPMG has concluded that Canada's total business tax costs are now the lowest in the G7, more than 40% lower than in the United States. Bloomberg now ranks us as the second most attractive destination for business in the entire world.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721589">Besides businesses, we are putting more money in the pockets of hard-working Canadians. Since 2006, we have cut taxes almost 180 times. We reject opposition demands for a job-killing carbon tax. We reduced the federal tax burden to its lowest level in over 50 years. For an average family of four, taxes have been cut by close to $3,400.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721590">However, this is not good enough. Like the Liberals and the NDP, we believe Canadians still do not keep enough of what they earn. With the Liberals and the NDP, Canadians can expect more spending and more taxes. The Conservative Party is the only party Canadians can trust to lower taxes. We have done it 180 times before and we will do it again when we achieve a balanced budget. Low taxes in business costs have helped create hundreds of thousands of jobs, but we are Conservatives. We always aim to do better.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="55">(1955)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3721591">Too many Canadians are still unemployed at a time when we are once again starting to see skills and labour shortages in some sectors and some regions. That is why the second pillar of our economic action plan supports the development of a skilled and productive workforce.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3721592">The centrepiece of this pillar is our Canada job grant. Through this program, federal funding will respond to the hiring needs of employers and will give them the opportunity to partner in skills training. While the opposition spends its time demanding temporary foreign workers for their favourite restaurants, we spend our time ensuring Canadians find jobs.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721593">The third pillar of the economic action plan is expanding markets. I cannot overstate how central this is to Canada's prosperity. In 2013 alone, Canada exported more than $559 billion in goods and services, and that is over $16,000 for every Canadian. Since 2007, we have reached free trade and investment agreements with 30 countries, and we are negotiating many more. In 2012, Canada joined the ambitious Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations. In March, we concluded negotiations for a free trade deal with the Republic of Korea, Canada's first in Asia.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721594">However, the real game changer is our agreement in principle toward a comprehensive economic and trade agreement with the European Union. This is the most comprehensive free trade agreement in the history of our nation, more ambitious than NAFTA itself. The EU market, with 500 million affluent people and annual economic activity of over $17 trillion, holds a continent of opportunities for Canadians.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721595">The joint Canada-EU study suggests CETA would boost Canada's income by $12 billion annually. Bilateral trade could increase by 20%, the equivalent of offering the average Canadian family a pay raise of $1,000.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721596"> While the NDP wastes time debating whether it supports trade, our Conservative government is getting the job done.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3721597">It is essential that we create new opportunities for Canada's natural resources sector. Natural resource projects with a total value of $650 billion will be under way or planned over the next 10 years.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721598">The fourth pillar of the economic action plan aims to make Canada a 21st-century natural resources superpower. We are planning major new initiatives to improve safety and emergency planning, as well as to enshrine the polluter pay principle in legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721599">The fifth pillar of our plan would make Canada a global innovation leader. Since 2006, we have made new investments of over $11 billion to support innovation in every way possible, from basic and applied research to infrastructure and commercialization. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721600">In economic action plan 2014, we propose new support for research and innovation totalling $1.6 billion over the next five years.

There is no question that a growing economy addresses the debt issue in part, but of course that only can happen if we are not in a deficit situation, so when we get out of the deficit situation and move to a surplus next year, the growth in the economy will of course, over time, reduce the ratio of debt to GDP.

I think the member opposite was actually implying that I agreed with the proposition of his leader, that budgets balance themselves. This, of course, is not reality.

Unlike the high-tax, high-spend Liberals, our Conservative government believes in low taxes, leaving money where it belongs, in the pockets of hard-working Canadian families. We have a strong record of tax relief. It has meant saving nearly $3,400 for a typical family of four. This includes cutting the lowest personal income tax rate to 15%, increasing the amount Canadians can earn without paying tax, introducing pension income splitting for seniors, reducing the GST, eliminating over a million poor Canadians from the income tax roles, introducing and enhancing the workers' income tax benefit, and the list goes on. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Ralph Goodale</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3721650">Mr. Chair, the minister appears to have no explanation for why the government considers children in low-income families less deserving than children in high-income families. That is the problem. It is unfair. It is discriminatory. Availability of tax credit should not depend upon one's level of income.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721651">I have another question. I would like to ask the minister about the registered disability savings plan. It is a plan that I think is broadly supported in the House. It is a good idea as a matter of policy principle and an idea upon which some improvements have been made in recent budgets. That is all to the good. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721652">However, there is still a key flaw in the design of the registered disability savings plan, which is the exclusion of those with certain impending disabilities, like multiple sclerosis, for example, where a person may be diagnosed with that debilitating disease. They do not have any symptoms at the moment, but inevitably, at some point down the line, they will begin to suffer from those symptoms. The requirement of the registered disability savings plan is that to be eligible, one must qualify fully for the disability tax credit. That means one must be fully disabled before one can apply for the plan. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721653">That means if people with MS, who knows what their long-term prognosis is likely to be, wants to set up a plan now, they are ineligible because they are not fully disabled now. It is a simple problem to solve for the government. Does the government have the intention, in the next budget, of bringing this correction into place so that those who are diagnosed but not yet fully disabled can begin to save when they still have some earning power and can still be gainfully employed and therefore take maximum advantage of this good idea? </ParaText><ParaText id="3721654">It is a good idea.

In its last financial statements, the government indicated that, before it gets to the point of a prospective balance sometime in the next year or so, it will have accumulated $163 billion in new federal debt under this government. That works out to approximately $20,000 in new Conservative debt for every Canadian family. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721659">Does the minister take satisfaction in that debt number?

It is a key part of our economic policy that has placed Canada in the best possible position to weather the recent global recession. It is why I am especially pleased to report that the government is well on track to return to balanced budgets in 2015. The deficit has been reduced by almost two-thirds since 2009-10 through our Conservative government's fiscal responsibility and sound economic policy. Including measures in economic action plan 2014, the deficit is project to fall to $2.9 billion in the current fiscal year. A surplus of $6.4 billion is expected in 2015-16 after taking into account a $3-billion annual adjustment for risk.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721663">While this is indeed good news, it is also crucial that Canadians understand that balancing the budget is not an end in itself, but rather a means to deliver on the priorities of Canadians, increase Canada's economic potential, improve employment opportunities, and raise all Canadians' standard of living.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721664">First, let me remind hon. members of the distinction between our Conservative government and that of the previous Liberal governments.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721665">Canadians can rest assured that federal transfers to individuals that provide important income support, such as old age security and major transfers to other levels of government for social programs and health care, will not be cut but rather will continue to grow over the forecast horizon. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721666">The cornerstone of the government's efforts to create jobs and opportunities for Canadians is the commitment to return to balanced budgets in 2015. As economic action plan 2014 makes clear, the government is on track to deliver on this commitment. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721667">I will explain, first, what the merits of balancing the budget are; second, how controlling government program spending and improving the integrity of the tax system are crucial to honouring our commitment to balance the budget; and third, how this strategy is and will continue to create the winning conditions for businesses to grow and compete.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721668">I also wish to put this in the broader context by pointing out that since the beginning of the recovery, Canada has achieved one of the best job-creation records in the G7 countries as well as one of the G7's best economic performances.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721669">Balancing the budget and reducing debt are not an end to themselves. Balancing the budget and reducing the debt are a means to increase Canada's economic potential, and as stated previously, to improve employment opportunities and increase the standard of living of Canadians.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721670">The government's plan to return to balanced budgets ensures tax dollars are used to support important social services like health care rather than paying interest costs. It preserves Canada's low-tax plan and allows for further tax reductions, fostering growth and the creation of jobs for the benefit of all Canadians. It helps to keep interest rates low, instilling confidence in consumers and investors whose dollars spur economic growth and job creation. It strengthens the country's ability to respond to longer-term challenges, such as population aging and unexpected global economic shocks. It also signals that public services are sustainable over the long run and ensures fairness and equity for future generations by avoiding tax increases or reductions in services. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721671">Canada's responsible fiscal position is critical to economic growth and job creation for the long term. Canada's efforts to pay down debt before the global recession and control spending have helped ensure that Canada's net debt-to-GDP ratio is the lowest by far of any G7 country and among the lowest of advanced G20 countries as well. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721672">While other countries continue to struggle with debt that is spiralling out of control, Canada remains in an enviable fiscal position among G7 countries. It is also why Canada is among only a handful of countries with an undisputed AAA credit rating with a stable outlook from all major credit rating agencies. I should also point out that Canada is the largest economy that still has an AAA credit rating.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="25">(2025)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3721673">Since budget 2010, our government has controlled direct program spending through targeted savings and reviews focused on reducing spending without compromising priority services to Canadians. Taking into account the new measures in economic action plan 2014, direct program spending is projected to remain broadly in line with the 2010-11 level over the forecast horizon. In fact, direct program spending has declined for three consecutive years, a trend that has not been observed in decades. Rest assured that federal transfers to individuals and major transfers to provinces and territories, including those for social programs and health care, will continue to increase.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721674">These steps have been accompanied by measures to improve the fairness and integrity of the tax system, with a view to ensuring that everyone pays their fair share. Consistent with this commitment, economic action plan 2014 includes measures that address international aggressive tax avoidance, improve tax integrity and strengthen tax compliance, and enhance the fairness of the tax system. Since 2006, and including measures in economic action plan 2014, the government has introduced more than 85 measures to improve the integrity of the tax system.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721675">Together, measures in economic action plan 2014 to address international aggressive tax avoidance, improve tax integrity, strengthen tax compliance, and enhance the fairness of the tax system will provide savings of $44 million in 2014-15 and rising to $454 million in 2018-19, for a total of $1.8 billion from 2013-14 through the following five years.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721676">Our government recognizes the importance of businesses to job creation and economic development. Our government delivered tax reductions totalling more than $60 billion to job-creating businesses from 2008 through 2014. Among these tax-relief measures were the reduction of the federal general corporate income tax rate to 15% in 2012 from over 22% in 2007 and an extension, through 2015, of the temporary accelerated capital cost allowance for machinery and equipment used in manufacturing and processing.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721677">Canada's tax competitiveness and overall business environment have been significantly improved, with the result that Canada now has the lowest overall tax rate on new business investment in the entire G7. The competitiveness of Canada's business tax system is supported by third-party analysis. KPMG's “Competitive Alternatives” 2012 concluded that Canada's total business tax costs are the lowest in the G7 and more than 40% lower than those in the United States. It is also why Canada has been ranked the second best place to do business in the world by Bloomberg, and KPMG's “Competitive Alternatives” 2014 study ranked Canada the most competitive, mature market country for business.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721678">The foundation of our initiatives since 2006 rests on the bedrock of a low-tax plan for jobs, growth, and prosperity. It has seen us through the worst of the global economic and financial crisis. While the NDP and the Liberals keep demanding reckless spending and want to impose higher taxes, our Conservative government remains on track to return to balanced budgets in 2015-16. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721679">We cannot be complacent and must make tough decisions. That is the core of economic leadership and fiscal responsibility, the very same leadership that has allowed Canada to lead the global economic recovery.

This could translate into weaker than expected growth for these countries and increased volatility in global capital markets. In addition, the pace of economic growth in the U.S. was much weaker than expected during the first quarter of the year. While growth was affected by temporary factors, including severe winter weather, there is a risk that the projected pickup in U.S. growth during the remainder of this year could be lower than expected. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721684">In light of these risks, for fiscal planning purposes, the government has maintained the downward adjustment for risk to the private sector forecast for nominal GDP at $20 billion for 2014 through 2018.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721685">The government will continue to evaluate economic developments and risks to determine whether or not it would be appropriate to maintain this adjustment for risk in the future.</ParaText>

I have been sitting here for quite some time listening to the debate. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721764">I guess I am surprised. I thought that the NDP would have come with some positive suggestions, but again tonight it accuses us of ragging the puck. However, what we have seen is the NDP ragging the puck. It basically has no positive contribution to present at all. It is just criticism, as usual. It is always critical, never constructive. Those of us who have had to sit through NDP regimes know how damaging and destructive it is whenever it gets a chance to put any of its policies into place. It is because of the NDP's failed policies that some of us have seen our province fall decades behind others, so I understand why it would not want to present them here tonight. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721765">I am grateful for the opportunity to appear before this committee. In my time today, I would like to focus on the important contribution that natural resources, forestry, and agriculture make to the Canadian economy. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721766">They are a pillar of our Conservative government's action plan. These sectors create jobs and prosperity, particularly in rural communities across the country.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721767">Consider, for example, Canada's natural resource sector. The sector represents 18% of the economy and over half of our exports. It supports 1.8 million jobs directly and indirectly. Furthermore, it generates about $30 billion annually in revenue to governments, equal to approximately half of all spending, for example, on hospitals in Canada in 2013.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721768">There are hundreds of natural resource projects under way or planned in Canada over the next 10 years, representing a total potential investment of $650 billion. A significant element of this economic boost is represented by Canada's unique oil sands industry, and this sector is an asset that will increasingly contribute to the prosperity of all Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721769">The oil sands are among the world's largest technology projects, contributing about 275,000 jobs across Canada and $48 billion in GDP, numbers that could grow to an average of 630,000 jobs and a contribution of $113 billion in GDP per year up to 2035. This is owing to an increase in global demand for resources, particularly from emerging economies. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721770">Increasing global demand for resources such as oil, particularly from those economies, will create new economic and job opportunities from which all Canadians will ultimately benefit. However, Canadians will only reap the benefits that come from our natural resources once investments are made by the private sector to bring those much-needed resources to market. Approval processes can often be long and unpredictable. Delays and red tape often plague projects that pose few environmental risks. That is why our government has worked hard since 2006 to streamline and improve the regulatory process at the same time as it is safeguarding our environment.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721771">A modern regulatory system should support progress on economically viable major projects and sustain Canada's reputation as an attractive place to invest. That is why, as part of Canada's economic action plan, we are modernizing the federal regulatory system. We would establish clear timelines, reduce duplication and regulatory burdens, and focus resources on large projects with the greatest potential environmental impacts. For example, we would implement system-wide improvements to achieve that goal of one project, one review within clearly defined time periods.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721772">We have invested $54 million over two years to support more effective project approvals through the major project management office initiative. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721773">In the most recent budget, we supported the National Energy Board by announcing $28 million over two years for the comprehensive and timely reviews of applications and to support participant funding programs, and we would eliminate tariffs on mobile offshore drilling units used in offshore oil and gas exploration and development. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721774">We also announced an extension of the mineral exploration tax credit until March 31, 2015. This credit helps junior exploration companies raise capital by providing an incentive to individuals who invest in flow-through shares issued to finance mineral exploration. The credit is in addition to the regular deduction provided for the exploration expenses flowed through from the issuing company. Since 2006, this measure has helped junior mining companies raise over $5 billion for exploration.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721775">Our Conservative government has also amended the Coasting Trade Act to improve access to modern, reliable seismic data for offshore resource development. Offshore oil and gas developments create jobs and support economic growth in Canada's communities. Continued exploration activity is required to bring new projects to communities and sustain these economic benefits over the long term.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="55">(2055)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3721776">However, it depends on modern, reliable seismic technology and data, which is why amending the act would ensure companies have the information they would need to identify potential resource development opportunities.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721777"> In addition to supporting responsible resource development, we must not forget the important contribution our forestry sector makes to our country as well. Canada's forestry sector directly employs over 200,000 workers in all regions of the country, including in 200 communities that rely on the sector for at least 50% of their economic base. Our government has helped this vital industry stay strong. The investments in the forest industry transformation program introduced in budget 2010 have been very successful in enabling Canadian forest companies to lead the world in developing and demonstrating the viability of innovative technologies that improve efficiency, that reduce environmental impacts and that create high-value products from Canada's world-class forest resources. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721778">Through programs like IFIT, we have seen an over 1,000% increase in exports to China, which has helped this sector weather the economic downturn in the United States. For example, IFIT provided support to the Tolko Industries mill in Meadow Lake, Saskatchewan to develop the first facility in North America to use innovative technology to boost productivity by enabling the production of different types of oriented strand board on one single production line. Economic action plan 2014 will provide $90.4 million over four years, starting in 2014-15 to renew the IFIT program. Our government will continue to work with the forestry sector as it invests in innovative new products and pursues new markets for Canadian forest products.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721779">Finally, the last topic I would like to highlight is our support for the agriculture and agri-food sector. This sector accounts for $100 billion in economic activity and provides employment to over 2.1 million Canadians. It is a sector that we continue to support. Since 2007, we have partnered with federal, provincial and territorial governments. We have partnered with producers through a suite of business risk management programs, including agri-stability, agri-insurance, agri-invest and agri-recovery to provide assistance to producers in cases of severe market volatility and disasters. In addition, federal, provincial and territorial governments invested substantial amounts, actually over $2 billion during the first growing forward agricultural policy framework, to promote competitiveness and innovation, to promote food safety and environmentally responsible farming practices.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721780">In April 2013, working with the provinces, we introduced the new Growing Forward 2 policy framework, which will provide more than $3 billion over the next five years for investments, innovation, competitiveness and market development.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721781">In February, through economic action plan 2014, we announced the expansion of the types of farming livestock that qualified for tax deferral on sale by farmers dealing with drought or with excess moisture conditions.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721782">Since 2006, our government has continued to create the right conditions to enable Canadians and Canadian businesses to feel confident to invest, to create jobs, to participate in the global marketplace and to grow our economy. The role of government is to put in place the right balance of policies and initiatives to support growth and to unleash potential. That is exactly what we are doing. We believe it is the ingenuity and creativity of individual Canadians that will create lasting economic growth in jobs in their communities and across the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721783"> Considering the importance of this sector, I would like to ask the minister a question.

Promoting the exploration of Canada's mineral resources by junior exploration companies helps create jobs and economic development. By extending the mineral exploration tax credit, it will help junior exploration companies raise capital by providing an incentive to individuals who invest in flow-through shares issued to finance mineral exploration. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721789">Since 2006, the mineral exploration tax credit has helped junior mining companies raise over $5 billion for exploration. In 2012, over 350 companies issued flow-through shares with a benefit of the credit to more than 30,000 individual investors. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721790">Second, as the 2013 Speech from the Throne highlighted, Canada's forestry sector remains essential to Canada's rural economy. The government will continue to support innovation and pursue new export opportunities for the sector.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721791">Economic action plan 2014 will provide $18 million over four years, starting in 2014-15 to support early intervention measures to stop the spread of the spruce budworm in Atlantic Canada and Quebec, including $2 million through Natural Resources Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721792">The spruce budworm is one of the most damaging insects to spruce trees in Canada, causing defoliation and tree mortality. Early intervention to prevent the spread of spruce budworm in Atlantic Canada and Quebec will protect the region from losing valuable forest resources to the severe defoliation that would be caused by a major outbreak.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721793">Finally, our government will help ensure the agriculture and agri-food sector plays a significant role in the Canadian economy, accounting for over $100 billion in economic activity and providing employment for over 2.1 million Canadians in 2011.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721794">Economic action plan 2014 highlights measures that will expand the types of farming livestock that qualify for tax deferral on sale by farmers dealing with drought or excess moisture conditions.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Quite frankly, what I will also not do is disrespect your office, Mr. Chair, by sitting on the arm of my chair when I should be sitting in the chair.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721873">Over the next several minutes, I would like to provide an overview of our government's actions that have kept taxes low for families and businesses, and have led to the creation of jobs and opportunities, economic growth, and long-term prosperity for all Canadians. Supporting this track record is our unwavering commitment to return to balanced budgets in 2015, which will allow us to have more dollars available to invest in priorities that matter to Canadians and to allow even further tax relief for families.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721874">Allow me to elaborate on the measures we have taken since 2006 to keep taxes low. Our government has a proven track record of success when it comes to supporting families and communities. The opposition, on the other hand, has a proven record of voting against that support. For all Canadians out there watching, it is a fairly easy matter to check the record on how members of Parliament vote on various subjects. Certainly when it comes to tax relief for Canadians, the opposition has an extremely solid record of voting against tax relief for Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721875">We have worked hard to create economic advantages for all Canadians so they can enjoy a high quality of life and long-term prosperity. We have lowered taxes to the point where the overall federal tax burden is now the lowest it has been in 50 years. Going forward we will examine ways to provide further tax relief for Canadians while taking into account the goal of returning to balanced budgets by 2015.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721876">Unlike the high-tax NDP and Liberals, our Conservative government believes that Canadians should not pay more taxes, they should actually pay fewer taxes. In fact, our strong record of tax relief has meant savings of nearly $3,400 for a typical family of four in 2014, allowing them to invest those savings in important family priorities.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721877">Since 2006, our government has lowered taxes in a number of ways, including increasing the amount of income that all Canadians can earn without paying federal income tax, increasing the upper limit of the two lowest personal income tax brackets so that individuals can earn more income before being subject to higher tax rates, reducing the lowest personal income tax to 15% from 16%, and introducing the tax-free savings account to help Canadians save by earning tax-free investment income.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721878">Our government's ambitious agenda of tax relief for families, individuals, and businesses is aimed at creating a tax system that fuels job creation and growth in the economy, and allows Canadians to keep more of their hard-earned money.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721879">Our tax cuts have also given individuals and families the flexibility to make choices that are right for them. Our government support for families has also meant supporting the businesses that create good jobs, and allowing families to enjoy a high standard of living. In particular, we have taken action to lower taxes for businesses so that they can create good jobs here at home while allowing them to compete in the global economy.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721880">In 2007, prior to the global crisis, Canada implemented a bold tax reduction plan that would help brand Canada as an attractive destination for business investment. This plan has reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 22.12% in 2007. We legislated our rate reductions to just 15% today, one of the best records in the G7. In fact, Canada now has an overall tax rate on new business investment that is lower than can be found in any G7 country, and below the average of the 34 member countries of the OECD.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721881">We also recognize the vital role small businesses play in the economy and job creation.

Indeed, because of our low-tax plan, a typical small business with $500,000 of taxable income is now saving $28,600. That is a lot of money for a small business to invest back into that business, to invest in machinery, or to invest in human capital.

That is 800 million consumers accessible to Canadian businesses. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721887">I would like to conclude today with a few brief words on the impact our economic action plan has had and will continue to have on Canadians. In today's uncertain world, Canada's economic action plan is working. It is creating jobs, it is keeping our economy growing, and it will return us to balanced budgets in 2015, which bodes well for not only the current generation of Canadians, but also for future generations of Canadians who, quite frankly, the NDP quite often forgets about in its tax-and-spend scheme of today. </ParaText><ParaText id="3721888">A recent analysis by <I>The New York Times</I> of the Luxembourg Income Study suggests that Canada's medium-income households today are the richest out of 20 peer countries, including the United States. It also shows that Canada's medium-income households have seen increases of about 20% in their take-home incomes between 2000 and 2010. This confirms that our government's low-tax plan for jobs and growth is working and increasing long-term prosperity for all Canadians.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721889"> The federal tax burden is now the lowest it has been in more than 50 years and more than one million low-income Canadians have been removed completely from the tax rolls. The share of Canadians living in low-income families is now at the lowest level over the past three decades. That is worth repeating because we hear a lot from the opposition. The share of Canadians living in low-income families is now at the lowest level over the past three decades.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721890"> Going forward, the government will keep taxes low and will examine ways to provide further tax relief for Canadian families, while returning to balanced budgets.

Since 2006, our government has introduced significant broad-based tax cuts that have benefited Canadian families. For example, we have delivered on our commitment to reduce the goods and services tax to 5% from 7%. We have increased the amount that Canadians can earn without paying federal income tax. We have reduced the lowest personal income tax rate to 15% from 16% and increased the amount of income that individuals can earn before facing higher tax rates by increasing the upper limit of the two lowest personal income tax brackets.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721893"> We have introduced a tax-free savings account, which is an increasingly popular way for Canadians to save for their goals and their future.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721894">Canadian families are also benefiting from the introduction of the child tax credit, the children's fitness tax credit, and the children's arts tax credit.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721895">Indeed, Canadians at all income levels are benefiting from tax relief introduced by our government, with low- and middle-income Canadians receiving proportionally greater relief. Benefits for low- and middle-income Canadians delivered through the personal income tax system and support for families with children have also been increased and enhanced.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3721896">Our government has introduced the universal child care benefit, which provides $100 per month to families for each child under the age of six.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721897">We have introduced and enhanced the working income tax benefit, lowering the welfare wall and strengthening work incentives for low-income Canadians already working while encouraging other low-income Canadians to enter the workforce.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721898">We have increased the amount of income that families can earn before the national child benefit supplement is fully phased out and before the Canada child tax benefit base benefit begins to be phased out.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721899">We have maintained the GST credit level while reducing the GST rate by two percentage points, translating into about $1.2 billion in GST credit benefits annually for low- and modest-income Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721900">As a result of the tax relief provided by this government since 2006, more than one million low-income Canadians have been removed from the tax rolls.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721901">Overall, this government has cut taxes for an average family of four by close to $3,400.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721902">We have been able to accomplish all of this while still being frugal with taxpayer dollars by paying down $38 billion on the national debt before the recession, the lowest level in a quarter of a century. We have lowered the government debt to the lowest debt in the G7.</ParaText>

Moody's, Fitch, Standard and Poor's have reaffirmed our AAA rating, but there is more work to do. Of every government revenue dollar, 11¢ goes to service the debt. We are committed to reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio to 25% by 2021, ensuring that future governments will have to mind the taxpayers' dime as we have through the introduction of balanced budget legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3721905">Most importantly, Canadians across the country can count on our Conservative government to keep their taxes low while continuing to examine ways to provide further tax relief for Canadian families.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I would like the opportunity to discuss our government's commitment to opening new markets for Canadian exports. </ParaText><ParaText id="3722068">Over the next several minutes, I am going to provide an overview of our government's actions that have opened new markets for Canadian businesses, allowing them to thrive and compete in the global economy, much like the Montreal Canadiens did tonight as they opened a new market called the “conference championship”, so it is good to see that.</ParaText><ParaText id="3722069">Through Canada's economic action plan, our government has delivered remarkable economic results for Canadians following the deepest global economic recession since the 1930s. We have provided a balance between stimulating our economy for the short term, balancing the budget in the medium term, and building our capacity in the long term.</ParaText><ParaText id="3722070">Contrary to what the opposition leaders may believe, our country remains in a very enviable position. Since the depth of the recession, over one million net new jobs have been created, most of them in high-wage industries. There are now over 600,000 more jobs than at the pre-recession peak, which is among the strongest job-growth records among G7 countries over the course of the recovery. Almost 90% of all jobs created since July 2009 have been full-time positions, with close to 85% of those coming from the private sector. It is clear that Canada's economic action plan has established a solid foundation that has allowed Canadian businesses to create jobs and drive economic growth.</ParaText><ParaText id="3722071">That said, our government is under no illusions that our work here is finished. We have some major challenges ahead. The global economy remains fragile, with growth in advanced economies slower than expected. Canada is at risk from the financial instability beyond our shores. Indeed, the head of the IMF recently noted that the great recession is not yet completely over for many countries, noting specifically:</ParaText><ParaText id="3722072"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">...that does not mean that the crisis is over and our mission accomplished. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3722073">She argued that the crisis will not be over until the flow of credit from banks in southern Europe is repaired, adding: </ParaText><ParaText id="3722074"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">In addition, the permanently low inflation brings additional risks.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3722075">Given this environment, our government understands that Canadians' standard of living and future prosperity depend on growing trade and investment. That is why Canada's economic action plan actively pursues new trade and investment opportunities, particularly with large, dynamic, and fast-growing economies. I was particularly encouraged to hear our <Affiliation DbId="170683" Type="4">Minister of International Trade</Affiliation> speak today in question period about his upcoming trade missions to China and to Africa, as the hard-working minister continues to develop our trade markets around the world.</ParaText><ParaText id="3722076">Our government has pursued the most ambitious trade agenda in Canadian history. Since 2006, our government has increased the number of free trade arrangements Canada has from five countries to an astounding 43 countries. </ParaText><ParaText id="3722077">Looking forward, the Canada–European Union comprehensive economic and trade agreement would eliminate an additional $750 million in annual tariffs on imports from the EU. The Canada–European Union comprehensive economic and trade agreement is by far Canada's most ambitious trade initiative, deeper in ambition and broader in scope than the historic North American free trade agreement, which we all refer to as NAFTA. In fact, the comprehensive economic and trade agreement would add more than 80,000 new jobs to the Canadian economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="3722078">John Manley, president and CEO of the Canadian Council of Chief Executives, had this to say:</ParaText><ParaText id="3722079"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">A strong and ambitious trade agenda continues to be at the core of this government's strategy for jobs and economic growth....

Almost 94% of E.U. agricultural tariff lines will be duty free when CETA comes into effect. </ParaText><ParaText id="3722081">I would be remiss if I did not talk a bit about the impact this would have in New Brunswick as well. When we look at some of our major sectors in New Brunswick, we see that just in the service sector, approximately 75% of the provincial GDP in New Brunswick comes from the service sector, and it employs over 277,000 people. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="25">(2225)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3722082">Access to the European service economy, which is valued at $12.1 trillion, opens up a significant market to auditing, architecture, engineering, finance, investments, software development, health and life sciences, and aerospace development and defence.</ParaText><ParaText id="3722083">I should also indicate that between the exports of fish and seafood products, as well as value-added forestry, and New Brunswick's world-class agriculture and agri-food products, we are talking somewhere in the order of about 30,000 direct jobs just in those three sectors in the New Brunswick economy. I have probably one of the largest per capita potato-producing regions in the country, with two large McCain Foods plants. The tariffs on frozen potato products going to the EU is currently 17.6%. This trade agreement is significant for New Brunswick. It is significant for those major industries. When we look at the value-added wood products again, plywood, veneer products, there is a 10% duty. This means significant benefit to New Brunswick, not just in sectors but clear across the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="3722084">Our government has successfully negotiated an outcome that allows Canadian exporters to benefit from tariff-free access, as I have indicated, making Canadian products cheaper and more competitive, and providing our exporters a significant advantage over their competitors. In this deal we are ahead of the U.S. in getting entry into that market.</ParaText><ParaText id="3722085">In addition to opening new markets in Europe for Canadian exporters, we are also concentrating our sights on the lucrative and fast-growing Asian market. For example, we recently reached a landmark agreement with South Korea. This is Canada's first trade agreement in this Asia-Pacific region and will provide new access for Canadian businesses and workers to the world's fifteenth largest economy and the fourth largest in Asia. South Korea is not only a major economic player in its own right and a key market for Canada, it also serves as a gateway for Canadian businesses and workers into the dynamic Asia-Pacific region as a whole. The agreement will eliminate an additional $176 million in annual tariffs on imports from Korea.</ParaText><ParaText id="3722086">Canada is also actively engaged in the trans-Pacific partnership negotiations that will open new markets and deepen our ties with several Asian economies, including Japan. Canada was built on trade and now more than ever before we are looking to diversify and deepen our trade relationships. Unlike the opposition, our government understands that pursuit of free trade is key to our growth agenda. Too often, as we often hear in this House, growth policy is characterized by only fiscal stimulus. Growth policy is dictated by trade and a low-tax environment for our businesses.</ParaText><ParaText id="3722087">In our view, a diverse and balanced growth agenda includes structural reforms, including trade liberalization, that allow for Canadian businesses and their workers to compete more effectively in global markets. With one of the most successful economies in the world today, Canada offers many advantages as an investment destination and partner for global business. Canada's competitiveness, excellence, depth of talent, innovation, and creativity offer a great environment to potential investors from around the globe.</ParaText><ParaText id="3722088"> Our government remains firmly committed to supporting Canadian jobs and fostering long-term prosperity for Canadians and their families. The low-tax approach I just mentioned in Canada's economic action plan continues to be a beacon to other nations around the world in a time of global economic uncertainty. </ParaText><ParaText id="3722089">In 2007, prior to the global crisis, Canada passed a bold tax reduction plan designed to brand Canada as a low-tax destination for business investment and we have since been recognized the world over for just that.</ParaText><ParaText id="3722090"> The KPMG publication “Competitive Alternatives 2012” rigorously analyzed the impact of federal, state, provincial, and municipal taxes on business operations.

These measures benefit not only Canadian businesses, which create jobs and keep our economy strong, but they also benefit Canadian consumers and families.</ParaText><ParaText id="3722102">Our government is focused on creating jobs and opportunities for hard-working Canadians in every region of the country. Providing businesses, especially the crucial small and medium-size enterprises, or SMEs, which employ so many Canadians, with new and improved market access so they can expand and compete globally is a key part of our government's pro trade plan, the most ambitious in our nation's history. </ParaText><ParaText id="3722103">Through CETA, our government is creating new and historic opportunities in Europe for agricultural exporters from across Canada. Indeed, Canadian workers in every region, including the Atlantic provinces, in such sectors as fish and seafood, chemicals and plastics, forest products, advanced manufacturing, ICT, metals and minerals, and agriculture and agri-foods, to name just a few, will benefit from increased access to the lucrative EU market.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3722104">Another agreement in Canada's pro trade plan is the Canada-India comprehensive economic partnership agreement, CEPA, which remains a key priority. There has been good progress in all areas under negotiation and Canada seeks to conclude negotiations with India as soon as possible. A trade agreement with India would eliminate or reduce tariffs on goods and liberalize trade and services. When it is in place, CEPA will play an important role in boosting trade and investment, creating more jobs and increasing prosperity for Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="3722105">More recently, one of our major accomplishments with respect to our trade agenda has been the new free trade agreement reached with South Korea, Canada's first in the fast-growing Asia Pacific region. The Canada-Korea free trade agreement will provide Canadian businesses and workers with unprecedented access to South Korea, directly benefiting Canada's SMEs. </ParaText><ParaText id="3722106">Specific measures that will help SMEs to access the South Korean market include: eliminating tariffs, locking in fair and predictable conditions for businesses and ensuring non-discriminatory treatment; that is that each country treats the other companies and goods the same way as it treats its own. The agreement will result in increased trade opportunities through tariff elimination in a broad range of sectors, such as industrial goods, for example, aerospace, information communication technology, metals and minerals, chemicals, plastics, pharmaceuticals, industrial machinery, cosmetics, agri products, forestry and value added products. The agreement will provide Canadians with access to new markets. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Joe Oliver</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3722188">Mr. Chair, while many sectors of the economy and regions of the country have skilled job shortages, too many people remain unemployed. Many employers continue to identify the shortage of skilled labour as an impediment to growth. To overcome this challenge, our economic action plan 2013 announced the reform of the three major labour market transfers to provinces and territories in order to transform support for skills training and help to ensure that federal funding responds to the hiring needs of employers. We have made significant progress toward meeting this goal.</ParaText><ParaText id="3722189">First, the core labour market agreements are being reformed with the introduction of the Canada job grant. They are accordingly being renamed the Canada job fund. This will encourage greater employer participation in skills training decisions and ensure that training is better aligned with job opportunities, particularly in sectors facing skills mismatches and labour shortages.</ParaText><ParaText id="3722190">Agreements in principle have been reached with all provinces and territories on the delivery of the Canada jobs grant, which is expected to be available to Canadian employers by July 1 of this year. Including employers' contributions, the grant could provide up to $15,000 per person toward training costs for a new or better job.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3722191">Second, the long-standing labour market agreements for persons with disabilities are being reformed to ensure federal funding supports programing that better helps Canadians with disabilities to obtain the skills they need to fill available jobs. These new agreements will require all jurisdictions to set up a formal process to engage employers and disability community organizers in identifying key labour market barriers and opportunities for persons with disabilities and set corresponding priorities for programing. This will not only support better employment prospects for persons with disabilities, but it will also better meet the employment needs of businesses.</ParaText><ParaText id="3722192"> We are also working to reform the $1.95 billion a year labour market development agreements with all provinces and territories to reorient training toward labour market demand, as we have with the other federal labour market transfers. Taken together, these renewed labour market agreements will be fundamental in helping to better connect Canadians with available jobs and advance our record of achievement in creating jobs and growth.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3722193">We are also taking significant action to that end outside the agreements. For example, our government is creating the Canada apprentice loan to help registered apprentices with the cost of their training. We will also improve the employment insurance system to ensure those on EI will receive more up-to-date information. We are also investing in an enhanced job matching service to ensure that Canadians are given the first chance at available jobs that match their skills in their local area. We are reforming the temporary foreign worker program to ensure that Canadians get the first crack at available jobs and employers hiring temporary foreign workers have a plan to transition to the Canadian workforce.</ParaText><ParaText id="3722194">These are important areas where our Conservative government is making real progress in helping connect Canadians with available jobs while advancing our record of achievement in supporting jobs and growth. While the opposition continues to vote against every one of these job creating measures, our government will stay the course and focus on what matters to Canadians.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Adler" id="8363694"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170479" Type="2">Mr. Mark Adler (York Centre, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3722258">Mr. Chair, it is a great honour to be here this evening to discuss how our government has lowered taxes for seniors and has strengthened Canada's retirement income system.</ParaText><ParaText id="3722259">Since 2006, our government has delivered approximately $2.8 billion in annual targeted tax relief for seniors and pensioners. The opposition has fought tooth and nail against every initiative that we have attempted to bring in to lower taxes for Canadians and for seniors. I hope the opposition understands that the way to help seniors is not to raise taxes, beginning with a $21-billion carbon tax.</ParaText><ParaText id="3722260">I hope that what I am about to say, and unfortunately I do not have the full ten minutes to say it, will be a learning experience for the NDP and the Liberals. I encourage them to listen very closely.</ParaText><ParaText id="3722261">Why did we place such importance on tax relief for seniors? Canadians know that our government focuses on what matters most to them. We heard from seniors across Canada who said that they wanted to keep more of their hard-earned dollars in their wallets, where it belongs. That is why we cut the GST from 7% to 6% to 5%. We introduced pension income splitting. We increased the age credit amount by $2,000. We doubled the pension income credit to $2,000 and created the tax-free savings account.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3722262">The tax-free savings account is the most innovative and popular savings vehicle since the RRSP. Initially allowing Canadians to save up to $5,000 a year, the tax-free savings account was expanded by our government due to popular demand. We now allow Canadians to save up to $5,500 a year. Members may be wondering how many Canadians have taken advantage of the TFSA that our government created. I am pleased to tell the House that more than nine million Canadians have taken out a tax-free savings account. The NDP and the Liberals voted against it.</ParaText><ParaText id="3722263">This has been particularly beneficial for seniors. Neither income earned in a TFSA nor withdrawals from a TFSA affect a senior's federal support, such as the guaranteed income supplement. </ParaText><ParaText id="3722264">We have also increased the amount that GIS recipients can earn through employment without any reduction in their benefits. We have increased the amount that recipients can earn from $500 to $3,500. For instance, a single pensioner earning at least $3,500 will now be able to keep up to an additional $1,500 in annual GIS benefits. This is important. We even introduced the largest GIS increase in 25 years. This is helping more than 680,000 seniors across Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="3722265">Our government's low-tax plan has even helped remove 380,000 seniors from the tax rolls altogether. In 2014, a single senior can earn $20,000 and a senior couple can earn $40,000 before paying any federal income tax. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3722266">Under the strong leadership of our <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, not only have we lowered taxes for seniors, we have also succeeded in ensuring that Canada's retirement income system remains strong. Today, Canada's low-income rate for seniors is one of the lowest in the industrialized world.</ParaText><ParaText id="3722267">Our government understands the importance of a secure and dignified retirement for Canadians who worked hard to build this great country. We want to ensure that Canadians have a secure retirement today and for future generations. Canada's retirement income system is renowned globally for preventing poverty among seniors and ensuring high levels of replacement income to retirees. Such high regard is based in no small part on the effectiveness of our government's actions. These actions have been effective because they are based on guiding principles of fiscal responsibility, sustainability, and innovation. We have applied these principles to strengthen the various pillars of Canada's retirement system with its balanced mix of private and public supports.</ParaText>
